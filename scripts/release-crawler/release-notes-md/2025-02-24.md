### Release notes for v4.5.1  
#### [kubebuilder v4.5.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v4.5.1)  
#### 2025-02-21  
**changes since [v4.5.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/v4.5.0)**

## ✨ New Features

> **Note:** This release includes only minor version updates.

* **(go-v4):** Upgraded `controller-runtime` from `v0.20.0` to `v0.20.2` ([#4528](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4528), [#4570](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4570))
* **(go-v4):** Upgraded `controller-gen` from `v0.17.1` to `v0.17.2` ([#4553](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4553))

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **(go-v4):** Aligned webhook suite tests with controller suite tests ([#4449](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4449))
* **(go-v4):** Fixed project initialization in directories containing other files. Now, initialization is only prevented for directories with explicitly unwanted files ([#4510](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4510))
* **(go-v4, kustomize/v2, helm/v1-alpha):** Fixed Prometheus integration by adding the `serverName` field to `ServiceMonitor`, ensuring proper certificate validation with the metrics server ([#4536](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4536), [#4558](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4558))
* **(CLI):** Fixed `kubebuilder alpha generate` by using `--repo` information tracked in the `PROJECT` file. Fix generation of projects outside of `GOPATH` ([#4559](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4559))
* **(go-v4, deploy-image/v1-alpha):** Fixed handling of missing boilerplate files by raising a warning instead of failing. Previously, the process would terminate with an error, but it now issues a warning and continues execution ([#4518](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4518)).
* **(go-v4):** e2e tests: Removed Prometheus dependency as part of cleanup and fixes, since it is optional and not required ([#4529](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4529))

**Thanks to all our contributors!** 🎉
