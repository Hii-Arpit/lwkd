LWKD is a weekly newsletter summarizing code activity in the Kubernetes project: merges, PRs, deprecations, version updates, release schedules, and community meetings.  It does not cover events or news in the Kubernetes ecosystem, as our sister publication [KubeWeekly](https://www.cncf.io/kubeweekly/) does a great job of handling those.

LWKD is the product of [contributors from the Kubernetes Project's SIG-Contributor Experience](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io).  If you're interested in helping with LWKD, see our [README](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io).  You can also contact us at lwkd@kubernetes.io.
