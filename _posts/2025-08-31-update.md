[132798: Show simple values in validation rule failures](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132798) 

This PR improves error messages from CEL validation in CRDs; Previously, failures displayed the field type (for example, "string") instead of the value that caused the failure; Now, when the value is a number, boolean, or string, the error message shows that value; This makes validation errors clearer and easier to understand.


[133323: Make kubectl auth reconcile retry on conflict](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133323)

This PR improves the `kubectl auth reconcile` command; Before, if the command tried to update an object and hit a conflict (for example, because another change happened at the same time), it would fail right away; Now, it retries when a conflict occurs, making the command more reliable when multiple updates happen concurrently.
