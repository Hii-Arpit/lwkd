## Developer News

Voting has begun for the [Kubernetes Steering election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2023); cast your ballot on [the election site](https://elections.k8s.io/), which also tells you if you're eligible or not.  If you're not, and should be, then [request an exception](https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/steering---2023/exception).  With 11 candidates for four seats, this will be a tough one, so give yourself some time.

[CVE-2023-3676](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/119339), [CVE-2023-3955](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/119595), and CVE-2023-3893 were reported for Windows Kubernetes, and are patched in the current update releases.  These are high-risk security issues, and all Windows users should upgrade as soon as possible.

The #kubernetes-contributors Slack channel [has been split](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/E1SeJvWQgzQ) into #kubernetes-new-contributors and #kubernetes-org-members.  The former will be the channel for introductions, getting started and mentorship requests, whereas org-members will be for established contributor communications.

The SIG-Contribex mailing list [will be migrated](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/wETk0QU0ZSI) to a project-controlled GoogleGroup on September 1.  This is the first of many mailing list migrations.

Han Kang [started a discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MAANihiX5lUE-PYIaNIgkK9l7MH1btl7q-iq6K9DUWI/edit) on replumbing Kubernetes for safer upgrades.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.29 Begins, September 5**

We are in the interval between releases, but if you wanted to be part of the 1.29 release team, [there is still time to apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfo4EXVqjlHzz2QPeNqar8dprZV06ETm740VQASEQLHRCX1tw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Patch releases [1.28.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md), [1.27.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md), [1.26.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md), [1.25.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) came out last week.  These include important security patches for Kubernetes on Windows.  1.24 is now EOL, and users of 1.24 need to upgrade or look at their ecosystem support options.

## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4006: Transition from SPDY to WebSockets](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4006-transition-spdy-to-websockets)

Currently the communication involving bi-directional streaming between Kubernetes clients and the API server is done through SPDY/3.1 protocol. These include several `kubectl` commands like `kubectl exec`, `kubectl cp` (built on top of `kubectl exec` primitives), `kubectl port-forward` and `kubectl attach`. This KEP transitions the bi-directional communication protocol used from SPDY to WebSockets, since SPDY was deprecated in 2015. WebSockets on the other hand is a standardized protocol and provides compatibility with software and programming languages.

As of now, the bidirectional streaming is initiated from the Kubernetes clients, proxied by the API server and kubelet, and terminated in the container runtime. This KEP proposes to modify `kubectl` to request a WebSocket connection, and to modify the API server proxy to translate the `kubectl` WebSocket data stream into to a SPDY upstream connection. This way everything upstream the API server need not be changed in the initial implementation. This KEP is in alpha in v1.28.
