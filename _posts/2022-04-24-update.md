## Developer News

Our contributors have [spent a lot of time](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3139) discussing improving general Kubernetes
stability and reliability lately. Project leaders [are implementing several changes](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/6F3h0Z1QzVg)
in how new enhancements will be handled:

* Expanding [Test Plan section](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3279) of the KEP template
* Enhancements may be blocked if they touch a poorly tested or unstable part of the code
* No more submitting tests in a "follow-up PR"
* Authors need to [check async tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/flaky-tests.md#deflaking-unit-tests) for race conditions

Also, the triage-bot will [stop closing](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/25967) high Priority, accepted bugs that become stale, so that we don't lose track of them.

The [Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcseu/) has a rough schedule now.  This will include a
Steering Committee AMA, three hours of Unconference sessions, a full day
Documentation Sprint, and several SIG/team meetings ([sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS1q4VJajZkNZODdMnJ4eH3XnTsE_4em6pjQgToHyfw/edit?usp=sharing)). The Contributor Social that evening will include board games
(bring yours!) and a Kubernetes trivia contest.  [Register now](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcseu/registration/).
Masks and COVID immunization will be required.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release, May 3rd**

[1.24 RC 1 is available](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) for your testing pleasure.

We are currently in Test Freeze and Code Freeze as the Release Team works with all
contributors to get 1.24 stabilized for final release after the incorporation of
[golang 1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109461). If you
get a reminder from the team to look at/fix something, please respond ASAP as
any delay can result in a release delay.

On TestGrid, the [following blocking test jobs](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.24-blocking) continue to be flaky: gce-cos-k8sbeta-default, gce-cos-k8s-beta-ingress, gce-cos-k8sbeta-reboot, kind-1.24-parallel, kind-ipv6-1.24-parallel, and ci-kubernetes-unit-1.24. Flaky jobs mean that we can't easily tell whether something is broken or not, so won't you pick a test job and dive in?  See the [CI Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/views/1) for ongoing work.

## Featured PRs

### [ingress-nginx#8456: Implement object deep inspector](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/8456)

Ingress-nginx released v1.2.0 this week, fixing two security issues: [CVE-2021-25745](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8502) and [CVE-2021-25746](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8503). Both are variants on using a malicious Ingress object to exfiltrate sensitive data from inside the Ingress Controller Pod, such as the Service Account credentials. This PR introduces both a fix for the two specific issues as well as a general framework for improved object validation within ingress-nginx. If upgrading isn't an option, you can also use the [`annotation-value-word-blocklist` configuration option](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist) to block the malicious Ingresses. If you permit low-privilege users to create arbitrary Ingresses, you should patch or mitigate these vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

## Other Merges

* In-tree GCE persistent data tests [have been disabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109541) since folks are supposed to have migrated to CSI a while ago

## Version Updates

* [etcd 3.5.4](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.4) fixes the [data corruption issue](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/postmortems/v3.5-data-inconsistency.md) and makes it safe (and recommended) to use etcd 3.5 for your Kubernetes clusters
* [cadvisor to 0.44.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109658)
* [containerd to 1.6.2 on Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109592)
