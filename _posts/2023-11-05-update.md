## Developer News

After a bit of a hiatus, WG-LTS has been restarted and is running a [survey about the upgrade experience](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/mrBWoCRSKlE) to gather information from the community as they decide what the needs of an LTS version of Kubernetes would be in the current environment.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze, November 15th**

Code freeze continues, with much of the release team at KubeCon NA updates have been low. Please continue to assist with any requests to clear broken or flaky tests so we can keep things on schedule.

## Featured PR

### [#113374: Implement ClusterTrustBundlePEM projected volume](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113374)

Previously called `PEMTrustAnchors`, this feature adds a dedicated way to manage TLS certificate bundles and distribute them to workloads. It comes in two parts, a `ClusterTrustBundle` resource type and a `clusterTrustBundle` projected volume source. The `ClusterTrustBundle` allows creating a cluster-scoped (i.e. non-namespaced) home for a certificate or chain of certificates, with a signer name and the usual metadata labels. These can then be referenced in a projected volume mount, either directly by name or via label selector if you want to automate the handling of multiple trust roots or root rotations.

Projected volumes are a type of virtual volume source that can map multiple types of metadata into a single mount folder inside a pod. Currently they support the `downwardApi` to get information about the Pod itself, `serviceAccountToken` for accessing specialized bound tokens, as well as `configMap` and `secret` with their usual support. The new `clusterTrustBundle` type collects one or more `ClusterTrustBundle` objects, combines their PEM data, and exposes it into the requested path.

While not included in this PR, discussions have already started around how to extend this concept to a namespaced `TrustBundle` type in the future.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 727 - Kubelet Resource Metrics Endpoint](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/727-resource-metrics-endpoint)

This KEP adds a new metrics endpoint to the kubelet, which serves metrics required by the cluster-level [Resource Metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics#resource-metrics-api). This KEP proposes adding a `/metrics/resource` endpoint in the kubelet which exposes metrics in the Prometheus text exposition format. This would provide the minimum set of metrics required to serve the Resource Metrics API.

This KEP is targeting the stable milestone in the upcoming v1.29 release.
