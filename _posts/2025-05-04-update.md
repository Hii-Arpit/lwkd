## Featured PRs

[131627: kube-apiserver to treat error decoding a mutating webhook patch as error calling the webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131627)

**kube-apiserver** now treats webhook patch decode failures as webhook call errors; This makes debugging easier by treating bad webhook patches as webhook errors instead of server errors.

[131586: Completion enabled for aliases defined in kuberc](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131586)

**kubectl** enables completion for aliases in **.kuberc**; makes CLI shortcuts easier to use by allowing shell autocompletion for custom command aliases.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 4818: Allow zero value for Sleep Action of PreStop Hook](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4818-allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook/README.md)

This KEP is built on [KEP-3960](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3960-pod-lifecycle-sleep-action), which introduced the sleep action for the `PreStop` hook, by allowing a duration of `0` seconds. Previously disallowed, this value is valid in Goâ€™s `time.After(0)` and acts as a no-op. The change enabled users to define PreStop hooks with `sleep: 0s`, useful for opting out of default webhook-injected sleeps without triggering validation errors.

This KEP was [implemented in Kubernetes 1.33](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4818-allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook/README.md).
