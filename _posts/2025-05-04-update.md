## Developer News

Joel Speed is being nominated as a technical lead for SIG Cloud Provider. This was discussed in the [April 23, 2025 SIG Cloud Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZE-ub-v6B8y-GuaWejL-vU_f9jsjBbrim4LtTfxssw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.y29cpq3g6i2i). Joel has been active in SIG Cloud Provider for about four years.

As development is being planned for the various SIGs for Kubernetes v1.34, Dims is requesting all contributors to evaluate the [current state of all feature gates](https://gist.github.com/dims/a0ecf5de51235968e12b9d6b62ac3a83) and see if progress can be made on moving them forward. Paco and Baofa created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxBtCeWOI8qWjF5jauT7pzfKwJssEhHErS4L6VcHgnU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) a few months ago to help get clarity on the state of the feature gates.

The [WG Node Lifecycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8396) has recveid tons of great feedback from the community and are co-ordinating with the stakeholder SIGs. The next step for the Working Group is to [vote on the time and schedule the first meeting.](https://doodle.com/group-poll/participate/dw72PQgd/vote). The first two meetings will be used to finalize the WG proposal and ensure that the goals are well defined and prioritized.

Your SIG has 1 week left to [propose a project for an LFX intern](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2025/02-Jun-Aug) for this term.  If someone has time to mentor, please pitch a project.

## Featured PRs

[131627: kube-apiserver to treat error decoding a mutating webhook patch as error calling the webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131627)

**kube-apiserver** now treats webhook patch decode failures as webhook call errors; This makes debugging easier by treating bad webhook patches as webhook errors instead of server errors.

[131586: Completion enabled for aliases defined in kuberc](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131586)

**kubectl** enables completion for aliases in **.kuberc**; makes CLI shortcuts easier to use by allowing shell autocompletion for custom command aliases.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 4818: Allow zero value for Sleep Action of PreStop Hook](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4818-allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook/README.md)

This KEP is built on [KEP-3960](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3960-pod-lifecycle-sleep-action), which introduced the sleep action for the `PreStop` hook, by allowing a duration of `0` seconds. Previously disallowed, this value is valid in Goâ€™s `time.After(0)` and acts as a no-op. The change enabled users to define PreStop hooks with `sleep: 0s`, useful for opting out of default webhook-injected sleeps without triggering validation errors.

This KEP was [implemented in Kubernetes 1.33](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4818-allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook/README.md).
