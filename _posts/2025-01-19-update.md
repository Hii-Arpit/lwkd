## Developer News

[CVE-2024-9042](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/129654) is a security vulnerability on Windows nodes that could let some users issue arbitrary commands via the `/logs` endpoint.  Patched in the latest update; all Windows users should update immediately.

Reminder to SIG and WG Chairs: [Annual Reports are due soon](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/D73_pD9jIRI).  This year's AR is really short, so don't procrastinate on it, just do it.

Start [using `Feature`, not `NodeFeature`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129166) for SIG-Node test labels.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, February 6**

We're still in Enhancements development, and Nina has shared the [first release newsletter](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ofJFFfOBhdc) with final dates for all release milestones.  This includes:

* Enhancements Freeze:  Friday, February 14th at 02:00 UTC
* Code and Test Freeze: Friday, March 20th at 02:00 UTC
* Release Day: Wednesday 23rd April 2025 

On the 15th the project released patch updates [1.29.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md), [1.30.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), [1.31.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md).  This update mainly patches the Windows security hole (above).

[129661: DRA CEL: Add Missing Size Estimator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129661)

This PR addresses a bug in the cost estimation of CEL expressions used in Device Resource Allocation (DRA).
Previously, attribute strings were treated as "unknown size", leading to overly high cost estimates and validation
errors for even basic expressions. The PR implements a proper size estimator, ensuring accurate cost calculations
by accounting for string lengths, map element limits, and avoiding misdefined pre-defined types like `apiservercel.StringType`.
This fix improves validation consistency and aligns with stored expression assumptions,
ensuring compatibility across version upgrades.
