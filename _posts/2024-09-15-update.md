## KEP of the Week

#### [KEP 3960: Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3960-pod-lifecycle-sleep-action)

This KEP proposes to add a "sleep" action for the Pod Lifecycle's PreStop and PostStart hooks. Before this KEP, for achieving the same result, users had to use the exec action and run the `sleep` command inside it. This required you to have a binary for the sleep command inside your image. Since this is a common usecase, this KEP proposed adding the sleep action as a first class citizen.

This KEP is targeting stable in the upcoming v1.32 release.
