## Developer News

With sadness we report the passing of [contributor Peeyush Gupta](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2021/06/01/peeyush-contributor-story/).  Peeyush was a regular contributor in SIG-ContribEx and a member of the 1.22 Release Team.  If you have remembrances of Peeyush to share, [add them to the memorial page](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/master/peeyush-gupta.md).

SIG-CLI would like to add a confirmation to [cascading deletes in kubectl](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/y4Q20V3dyOk).  This would be a breaking change, so please check out the proposal and the discussion.

Contributor Summit 2021 will likely be a "hybrid event", but we need to know how many folks will be there in person vs. virtually.  [Please let the summit team know](https://linuxfoundation.surveymonkey.com/r/BW9ZXX5) if you're planning on going, and if so how.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature exceptions due, June 28th**

Folks are hard at work coding and documenting their 1.22 features. [Don't forget about tests](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/H03JF6v3nu4), though; currently we have 4 jobs flaking in master-blocking, and a whopping 14 jobs flaking or failing in master-informing.  Let's fix these now and *not* have code freeze be a grueling slog of test fail debugging.

Cherry-pick deadline for the next [patch releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) is June 12.

## Featured PRs

### [#102343: Changes headers to remove "X-" prefix (IETF deprecation)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102343)

An extremely-niche-but-technically-a-compat-change tweak, the telemetry headers sent from `kubectl` to `kube-apiserver` are being changed to match IETF recommendations. `X-Kubectl-Command` is now `Kubectl-Command` and `X-Kubectl-Session` is `Kubectl-Session`. If you have some homebrew audit logging system that uses these headers, now is your chance to tweak it.

### [#101742: Promote DS MaxSurge to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101742)

Many DaemonSets provide critical node-level functionality that can make upgrades tricky. If the previous rolling update behavior was "at most one", by setting the new MaxSurge option you can instead get "at least one". This may not apply in all cases but for situations where overlapping during upgrades is preferable to a tiny outage, consider investigating this new option.

## Other Merges
