## Developer News

Stephen Augustus, Paco Xu, Patrick Ohly, and Maciej Suzlik [have been elected](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/jbbgiSWMq98) to the 2023-2024 Kubernetes Steering Committee.  Congrats to the new members, and thanks to everyone who voted.

The [schedule](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcsna/schedule/) for Contributor Summit Chicago is live.  Please [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcsna/registration/)

Mahamed Ali is [planning to replace kube-up with kops](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/bFARAiK-K90) for the E2E testing framework, mostly because kube-up is unmaintained.

Antonio Ojea [points out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120753) that there are some race conditions around Node IPs caused by the migration to external cloud providers.  He proposes [a change to readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120753) to mitigate this, but probably more is needed.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 6th**

John Belamaric also [clarified that PRR Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/CQ33yPqp-H4) means answering all the PRR questions, not having them approved yet.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-3705: Cloud Dual-Stack --node-ip Handling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/3705-cloud-node-ips)

This KEP proposes to add dual-stack `--node-ip` support to kubelet for clusters using a cloud provider. Currently it is only supported by bare metal clusters. This would allow admins of clusters on a cloud provider to override both node IPs on a node in a dual stack cluster. Currently if you pass `--cloud-provider` to kubelet, it expects `--node-ip` to either be unset or a single IP address. This KEP will allow comma separated dual-stack values for `--node-ip` in clusters using non-legacy cloud providers.

This KEP is targeting `beta` milestone in the upcoming v1.29 release is authored by [Dan Winship](https://github.com/danwinship)
