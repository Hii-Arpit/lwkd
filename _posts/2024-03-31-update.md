## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4381: Structured Parameters for Dynamic Resource Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4381-dra-structured-parameters)

Dynamic Resource Allocation, which was added to Kubernetes as an alpha feature in 1.26 defines an alternative to the traditional device plugin API for requesting access to third-party resources. By default DRA uses parameters for resources that are completely opaque to core Kubernetes. This approach creates issues for higher level controllers like the Cluster Autoscaler that needs to make decisions for a group of Pods. Structured Parameters is an extension to DRA that takes care of this problem by making claim parameters less opaque.

This KEP focusses on defining the framework necessary to enable different structured models to be added to Kubernetes over time and does not define one of the models itself. This KEP is tracked for alpha release in the upcoming 1.30 release.
