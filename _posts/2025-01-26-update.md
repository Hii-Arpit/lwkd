[128546: add PodReplacementPolicy for Deployments: terminating pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128546)

A new status field, `.status.terminatingReplicas`, has been added to Deployments and
ReplicaSets to improve visibility into terminating pods. This change is a prerequisite
for introducing `PodReplacementPolicy` in Deployments, which will provide more control
over pod updates. The new field is available when the `DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy`
feature gate is enabled.
