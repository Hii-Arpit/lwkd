## Developer News

[Staging Images are migrating off GCR](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/U5jTmvhoYLg) since Google Container Registry [is shutting down](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/issues/1343) in March.  If you manage a Staging repo, and want something to happen other than just moving to Artifact Registry, contact K8s-Infra very soon.  Users should already be using registry.k8s.io and are unaffected ... right?

[Code of Conduct Committee nominations](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/5hiqk29yDOw) are closing on January 31.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, February 6**

PRR Freeze is next week, so [John Belamaric has written](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/VF2xhhVGueg) a helpful guide on what you need to do.

## Featured PRs

[128546: add PodReplacementPolicy for Deployments: terminating pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128546)

A new status field, `.status.terminatingReplicas`, has been added to Deployments and
ReplicaSets to improve visibility into terminating pods. This change is a prerequisite
for introducing `PodReplacementPolicy` in Deployments, which will provide more control
over pod updates. The new field is available when the `DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy`
feature gate is enabled.
