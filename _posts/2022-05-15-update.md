## Developer News

[KubeCon EU 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) is getting under way right now. If you're attending in-person or virtually, enjoy!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.25 Cycle Starts, May 23rd**

We are in the "time between releases", which is actually the time contributors should be thinking about "what can I realistically get done for 1.25".  Enhancements Freeze is June 17th, so you want to have your development goals figured out before then.

Cherry Pick Deadline for the next patch releases is still May 20th, right after KubeCon.

## Featured PRs

### [#110013: Remove gcp and azure auth plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110013)

The in-tree kubectl authentication plugins for `gcp` and `azure` have both been deprecated since 1.22 and so the time has come to remove them. Both the [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) have documents showing how to install the equivalent out-of-tree plugins using the `exec` system. Even if not using a local build of `kubectl`, it would be wise to update your kubeconfigs so you aren't caught unawares in the future.

### [#108884: feat: implement node inclusion policy in scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108884)

#108884 and [#108492](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108492)come together to implement support for taint analysis for the pod topology skew system. Being an alpha feature this is behind the `NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread` feature gate but once enabled, try setting `nodeTaintsPolicy: Honor` in your `TopologySpreadConstraints` and skew calculations should take taints into account, making them more accurate for complex scenarios.
