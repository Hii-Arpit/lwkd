The Code Freeze milestone for Kubernetes 1.29 release cycle is approaching. Is everything checked in? This is followed by the regular release countdown: open docs PRs by Thursday, publish deprecations blog on Thursday, test freeze and finalize docs next week. As always, once weâ€™re in Code Freeze, please respond to test failure issues with alacrity.

## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3983 - Add support for a drop-in kubelet configuration directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/3983-drop-in-configuration/README.md)

This KEP adds support for drop-in configuration directory to the kubelet. The proposed way to configure the configuration directory is via a `--config-dir` flag. The flag will be empty by default and if nothing is specified, drop-in support will be disabled. Id the drop-in directory is enabled, it will override the configuration for the kubelet located at `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. Users would be able to configure individual kubelet config snippets in files, which would be formatted in the same way as the `kubelet.conf` file. The kubelet would process these files in alphanumeric order.

This KEP was in alpha stage in the v1.28 release, and is in track to graduate to beta in the upcoming v1.29 release.

* [ingress-nginx] - [CVE-2022-4886](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/t0GmcmXBknk/m/AjKpfD5mAgAJ), [CVE-2023-5043](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hIHcXt1BSc4/m/jOdUrT5mAgAJ) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uYVb6_5Nyvw/m/P0GNkT5mAgAJ) are high risk vulnerabilities identified last week in ingress-nginx. [CVE-2023-5043](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hIHcXt1BSc4/m/jOdUrT5mAgAJ) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uYVb6_5Nyvw/m/P0GNkT5mAgAJ) are vulnerabilities where the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` and `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` annotations can be used to inject arbritrary commands and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. This can be mitigated by setting the `--enable-annotation-validation` flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.
