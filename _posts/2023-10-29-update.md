## Release Schedule

The Code Freeze milestone for Kubernetes 1.29 release cycle is approaching. Is everything checked in? This is followed by the regular release countdown: open docs PRs by Thursday, publish deprecations blog on Thursday, test freeze and finalize docs next week. As always, once weâ€™re in Code Freeze, please respond to test failure issues with alacrity.
