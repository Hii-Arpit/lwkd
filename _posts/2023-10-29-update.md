## Developer News

As initially announced a few weeks ago, SIG K8s-infra is happy to finalize the [changing of the guard](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7584)! Aaron and Tim Hockin will be handing the reins over to [Ben](https://github.com/bentheelder), [Arnaud](https://github.com/ameukam), and [Mahamed](https://github.com/upodroid).

Kubernetes Contributor Summit: You still have 2 days to [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcsna/registration/) for the Summit in Chicago. We are also looking for [volunteers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/3_-SvFUSKLQ) to help staff it.  While you are welcome to attend only the [Social](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcsna/social/), you must still register to do so.  And bring your best Kubernetes-themed [poetry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NiPRrT5HpM42O8DQTv41DRufFiVXNcO39BFm50Uj1Ac/edit#gid=0) to the Social with you!  Finally, don't forget to join your favorite SIG(s) for the [Meet the Kubernetes Contributor Community](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/n-8ewEqd_U4) event on Thursday.

Label your tests!  We can now [choose which E2E tests to run](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/DTFEng143NY) through [Ginko v2 labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121391), but only if tests are labelled correctly.

There are several ingress-nginx security vulnerabilities, see below.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: CODE FREEZE, November 1st**

The Code Freeze milestone for Kubernetes 1.29 release cycle is here. Is everything checked in? This is followed by the regular release countdown: open docs PRs by Thursday, publish deprecations blog on Thursday, test freeze and finalize docs next week. As always, once weâ€™re in Code Freeze, please respond to test failure issues with alacrity. You can reach out to us on Slack in the [#sig-release](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C2C40FMNF) channel if you have any questions.

## Featured PRs

### [#116065: feature(scheduler): implement matchLabelKeys/mismatchLabelKeys in PodAffinity and PodAntiAffinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116065)

The affinity and anti-affinity settings are main workhorses of controlling Pod distribution over a cluster. They allow configuring co-location and avoidance with simple rules rather than more elaborate manual resource allocation either directly or with labeled worker pools. This PR adds a simple shorthand for two common scenarios: label selectors that use the label value from the pod under consideration without restating them. This reduces the need for external webhooks or templating tools for cases like "affinity match Pods from this deployment's current rollout":

```yaml
podAffinity:
  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    matchLabelKeys: [pod-template-hash]
```

This will be interpreted to:

```yaml
podAffinity:
  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    labelSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - key: pod-template-hash
        operator: In
        values: [84cd68b55b] # Value based on the Pod's labels
```

The `mismatchLabelKeys` field similarly converts to a `NotIn` operator, allowing things like single-tenant nodes in a multi-tenant infrastructure.

### [#121104: [KEP-3751] introduce the VolumeAttributesClass API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121104)

While size is generally the most important value for most persistent volumes, many providers offer other tunable parameters such IO Operations/Second (IOPS) and overall available bandwidth. Befitting its importance, we've long supported dynamic adjustment of the size of a volume (assuming the underlying provider also allows it), this PR adds similar capabilities for these other values as well. Some providers have supported setting them as custom parameters in the underlying StorageClass object, however there's no handling in CSI or Kubernetes for runtime adjustments to a StorageClass resulting in an update of all the related volumes. Enter VolumeAttributesClass, a new API type similar to StorageClass in that it defines a named set of provider-specific values (e.g. `iops`, `throughput`) which can be applied to a PersistentVolumeClaim. But unlike a StorageClass, the volumeAttributesClassName on a PVC can be changed after creation. So like with dynamic volume resizing, you could create a new VolumeAttributesClass with higher (or lower) values than the previous one and update your PVCs to the new class, triggering an update call in the CSI driver to work its magic. This provides a structured way to evolve storage requirements over time without sacrificing the benefits of the CSI abstraction.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3983 - Add support for a drop-in kubelet configuration directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/3983-drop-in-configuration/README.md)

This KEP adds support for drop-in configuration directory to the kubelet. The proposed way to configure the configuration directory is via a `--config-dir` flag. The flag will be empty by default and if nothing is specified, drop-in support will be disabled. If the drop-in directory is enabled, it will override the configuration for the kubelet located at `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. Users would be able to configure individual kubelet config snippets in files, which would be formatted in the same way as the `kubelet.conf` file. The kubelet would process these files in alphanumeric order.

This KEP was in alpha stage in the v1.28 release, and is in track to graduate to beta in the upcoming v1.29 release.

## Subprojects and Dependency Updates

* [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) - [CVE-2022-4886](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/t0GmcmXBknk/m/AjKpfD5mAgAJ), [CVE-2023-5043](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hIHcXt1BSc4/m/jOdUrT5mAgAJ) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uYVb6_5Nyvw/m/P0GNkT5mAgAJ) are high risk vulnerabilities identified last week in ingress-nginx. [CVE-2023-5043](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hIHcXt1BSc4/m/jOdUrT5mAgAJ) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uYVb6_5Nyvw/m/P0GNkT5mAgAJ) are vulnerabilities where the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` and `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` annotations can be used to inject arbitrary commands and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. This can be mitigated by setting the `--enable-annotation-validation` flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.
