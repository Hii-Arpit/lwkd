## Developer News

Just thought of a topic for the [Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcseu) but missed the CfP for planned sessions? Add your idea to the [Unconference voting issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7692).  Planned session confirmations will be sent out later this month.

Prow is [moving out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-2qcUD1K3xRV2FXJSf5G0aAMbALq709O9ZwYKKj0QM/edit) of it's parents basement (i.e. k/test-infra) into its own repo.

### [KEP-4192: Move Storage Version Migrator in-tree](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4192-svm-in-tree)

Kubernetes heavily relies on consistently updating stored resource data for various maintenance tasks related to storage. This includes scenarios like transitioning from one storage schema version to another (for instance, moving from `v1beta1` to `v1`) and updating encryption methods for data at rest. Currently, the common method for rewriting data involves issuing no-op `update` requests via `kubectl get <resource> | kubectl replace -`. However, this approach poses challenges, especially for resource-heavy entities like Kubernetes `secrets`, and requires automation due to the constantly growing number of resources needing migration.

During storage migration processes, conflicts during `update` requests can be safely ignored, and inconsistent continue tokens during paginated `list` operations are also deemed safe since the primary concern is rewriting data rather than how it's rewritten. This proposal seeks to simplify storage migrations for users by abstracting away these complexities.

This KEP was first released in v1.29 and is currently tracked for beta in the upcoming v1.30 release.
