## Developer News

Paris Pittman has [retired from the Steering Committee](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/3SpmzCuYgIY) as well as several other roles. Please join us in thanking Paris, who has done more to make Kubernetes an awesome project for contributors than possibly anyone else.  She is succeeded on the Steering Committee by Carlos Panato.

Etcd has [announced some new data consistency bugs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/sEVopPxKPDo).  Please upgrade etcd on your clusters to 3.4.22 or 3.5.6 as soon as you can.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs Complete, November 29th**

Just a few more things to finish off before 1.26 goes out, mostly the documentation and the feature blog.

[CI signal is OK](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/) but not great, with no tests failing (but some flaking) on [master-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) and a few failing on master-informing, particularly [cgroupv1-conformance](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/113767).  If this is something you can help with, please jump in.  In general, please treat any failing test issues in your notifications as *extremely urgent* until 1.26 is released.

## Merges

* New Tests: [wait for jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113927) to finish on termination, check that UDP-LB [doesn't blackhole requests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113650), [StorageVersionAPI unit tests(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113147)
* Wait for Job pods to [finish before checking if they failed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113860)
* Fixed [failure on encryption reload](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113955)
* Update old kubeadm versions [to pull from registry.k8s.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113388)
