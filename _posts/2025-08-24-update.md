## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Day 27th August**

Kubernetes v1.34 is released. 

A regression in kube-proxy v1.34.* that prevented startup on single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 hosts was identified and fixed ahead of release cut.
A huge thank you to all contributors, reviewers, and release team members whose efforts made this release possible!

The next scheduled patch releases are on September 9, 2025 (cherry pick deadline: September 5, 2025).
As a reminder, Kubernetes 1.31 will enter maintenance mode on August 28, 2025, with End of Life (EOL) planned for October 28, 2025.
