## KEP of the Week

[KEP 24: Add AppArmor Support](https://github.com/tallclair/k8s-enhancements/blob/3bfe4d0b1dcf20394fd2b2bc77ee50911b409fe8/keps/sig-node/24-apparmor/README.md)

This KEP introduces support for AppArmor within a cluster. AppArmor can enable users to run a more secure deployment, and/or provide better auditing and monitoring of their systems. The AppArmor support provides users an alternative to SELinux, and provides an interface for users that are already maintaining a set of AppArmor profiles. This KEP is proposing a minimal path to GA, per the no perma-Beta requirement.

This KEP is tracked for Stable in 1.34

## Shoutouts

* Christian Schlotter (@chrischdi): Thanks to Fabrizio Pandini (@fabrizio.pandini) and Stefan BÃ¼ringer (@sbueringer) for the huge amount of work they did for the latest cluster api :cluster-api: v1.11.0 release to set the stage for the v1beta2 api version, which benefits all users to have a more clear and consistent API as well as a better feedback loop!
