Note: there will be no LWKD update next week due to KubeCon Europe.

## Community Meeting Summary

Matt Rikard kicked off last week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) with a demo of [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/skaffold), Google's OSS tool for CI/CD development targeting Kubernetes clusters.

SIG updates:  Maciej Szulik explained the work that [SIG-CLI](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli) has been doing on "printing" object information (meaning formatting it for display through kubectl or the API).  In 1.11, this is moving to server-side formatting which supports pretty-printing of custom Kubernetes objects like CRDs. [SIG-AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-aws)'s Justin Santa Barbara mentioned their first [SIG repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/kubernetes-repositories.md#sig-repositories): [aws-encryption-provider](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-encryption-provider).  However, moving AWS out to Cloud Provider API is apparently stalled, and SIG-AWS could use help.  Adam Worrell gave the [SIG-GCP](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-gcp) update because he is the sole Lead for the SIG, something they're working on fixing. They've been having diffculty getting a lot of community interest in the SIG.

Announcements: [SIG-UI](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-ui/README.md) needs help revitalizing the Dashboard. CNCF needs contributors for "Meet the Maintainers" in their KubeCon booth.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: Feature Freeze, May 24th.*

That was Week 3 of 12 for 1.11.  Feature freeze is tommorrow, so [file your features](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues) in the Features repo.  Currently there are 41 features registered. [CI Signal Report](https://bit.ly/k8s111-cisignal) shows a lot of failing tests; SIGs need to work on debugging failures in order to shorten Code Freeze.

## Feature Work

* Add [the ability to dump its configuration to a file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62515) to the Scheduler.
* [Split the feature gates](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62243) for Pod-Priority and Pod-Preemption, so that users can enable them separately.
* [Add Prometheus cluster monitoring](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62195) to clusters created with kube-up.
* Support [standard Azure load balancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62707).
* Cinder volumes [now have metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62668).
* Pod status will [now show as Running](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62642) if some containers are running and others are Completed.
* Kubeadm can [upgrade and downgrade its own configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62568).
* QOS Reserved moves to [an alpha feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62509).
* Pod Affinity rules [may be empty](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62448), causing nothing to get scheduled.
* Portworx volumes [can be resized](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62308).
* Put bootstrap certificates [in the same location](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62152) as other certs.
* Kubeadm [adds a command for Kubelet config](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57224).

## Deprecated

* [`--include-extended-apis` is removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62803), having been deprecated back in 1.5.
* Kubelets are [dropping ExternalID](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61877) from node spec.

## Version Updates

* [GLBC to 1.1.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62751)
* [kube-DNS to 1.14.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62676)
* [Istio to 0.6.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61911)

## Other Merges

* The Metadata Agent [now actually gets created](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62909).
* [Fix anti-affinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62715) to properly match OR conditions, and fix Affinity so that [multi-pod services can be scheduled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62591).
* GLBC users can [scale default backends](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62685).
* Fixed [kubernetes.default.svc loopback](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62649).
* Allow kubeadm init to [proceed with alternate CRIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62481).
* [Fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62464) "Pod is terminated, but some containers are still running" issue.
* CRD generated code [needs to pass go vet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62412).
* [Restore scaling permissions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62336) for StatefulSets.
