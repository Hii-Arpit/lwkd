#125029 [kubeadm: enable the v1beta4 API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125029)

This PR introduces the `v1beta4 API` for kubeadm, incorporating essential changes to enhance functionality and support duplicate arguments in configurations. Special modifications include the restructuring of "extraArgs" into name/value pairs, updates to timeout fields, and a migration command to transition from v1beta3. While v1beta3 is now deprecated, it remains supported until version `1.34`.
