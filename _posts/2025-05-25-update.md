## Featured PRs

[131842: Add metrics for compatibility version](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131842)

This PR adds alpha metrics for binary, emulation, and minimum compatibility versions in `componentGlobalsRegistry`, exposed via Prometheus in kube-apiserver, scheduler, and controller-manager for observability of version negotiation; It introduces an AddMetrics method that publishes the binary version, emulation version, and minimum compatibility version of each component as Prometheus gauge metrics; Users can now monitor version negotiation for kube-apiserver, scheduler, and controller-manager using these metrics.

[128748: feat: introduce pInfo.UnschedulableCount to make the backoff calculation more appropriate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128748)

This PR updates the scheduler to separate scheduling failures caused by plugin rejections from those caused by internal errors; It introduces `UnschedulableCount` to track only plugin-based rejections, ensuring that transient errors like API failures or network issues do not increase backoff time unfairly; This change improves scheduling fairness and responsiveness under cluster instability.

[129983: feature(scheduler): Customizable pod selection and ordering in DefaultPreemption plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129983)

This PR introduces support for customizing pod selection and ordering in the DefaultPreemption plugin; It adds optional EligiblePods and OrderedPods function hooks, allowing scheduler integrations to override the default behavior without reimplementing the plugin; This enables more flexible preemption strategies while maintaining the existing plugin interface.

[131677: [Kubeadm]: Add support for ECDSA-P384 encryption algorithm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131677) 

This PR adds support for the `EncryptionAlgorithmECDSAP384` in kubeadm API types; Users can now choose `ECDSA-P384` for generating `PKI` assets like CA and component certificates during kubeadm init; Implemented key generation logic for ECDSA P-384 keys in pkiutil (using elliptic.P384()); This ensures the algorithm is handled correctly across `pkiutil` and cluster configuration paths.
