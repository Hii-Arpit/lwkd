## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, June 12th**

The Release Cycle for 1.34 has started, and the release team is actively [collecting enhancements](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/213/views/1). SIG Leads should discuss enhancements and add the `lead-opted-in` label for KEPs going into v1.34.

## Featured PRs

[131842: Add metrics for compatibility version](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131842)

This PR adds alpha metrics for binary, emulation, and minimum compatibility versions in `componentGlobalsRegistry`, exposed via Prometheus in kube-apiserver, scheduler, and controller-manager for observability of version negotiation. It introduces an AddMetrics method that publishes the binary version, emulation version, and minimum compatibility version of each component as Prometheus gauge metrics. Users can now monitor version negotiation for kube-apiserver, scheduler, and controller-manager using these metrics.

[128748: feat: introduce pInfo.UnschedulableCount to make the backoff calculation more appropriate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128748)

This PR updates the scheduler to separate scheduling failures caused by plugin rejections from those caused by internal errors. It introduces `UnschedulableCount` to track only plugin-based rejections, ensuring that transient errors like API failures or network issues do not increase backoff time unfairly. This change improves scheduling fairness and responsiveness under cluster instability.

[129983: feature(scheduler): Customizable pod selection and ordering in DefaultPreemption plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129983)

This PR introduces support for customizing pod selection and ordering in the DefaultPreemption plugin; It adds optional EligiblePods and OrderedPods function hooks, allowing scheduler integrations to override the default behavior without reimplementing the plugin. This enables more flexible preemption strategies while maintaining the existing plugin interface.

[131677: (Kubeadm): Add support for ECDSA-P384 encryption algorithm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131677)

This PR adds support for the `EncryptionAlgorithmECDSAP384` in kubeadm API types; Users can now choose `ECDSA-P384` for generating `PKI` assets like CA and component certificates during kubeadm init; Implemented key generation logic for ECDSA P-384 keys in pkiutil (using elliptic.P384()). This ensures the algorithm is handled correctly across `pkiutil` and cluster configuration paths.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4369: Allow almost all printable ASCII characters in environment variables](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4369-allow-special-characters-environment-variable/README.md)

This enhancement allowed all printable ASCII characters (with ASCII codes 32–126), except `"="`, to be used in environment variable names. Previously, Kubernetes imposed restrictions that could prevent certain applications from functioning as intended, especially when users couldn’t control the variable names. By lifting these constraints, the change improved compatibility with a broader range of applications and removed an adoption barrier, aligning Kubernetes behaviour more closely with real-world usage patterns

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
