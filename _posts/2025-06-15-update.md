## KEP of the Week

[KEP 2837: Pod Level Resource Specifications](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2837-pod-level-resource-spec/README.md)

The KEP extended the Pod API to support Pod-level resource limits and requests for non-extended resources in addition to existing container-level resource allocation. Previously, resource requests and limits could be set only at the container level, which limited flexibility and ease of resource management for the pod as a whole. The existing behaviour was problematic for users who wanted to limit the overall resource consumption of the entire pod.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
