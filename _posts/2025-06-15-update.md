## Developer News

Kubernetes Slack is [downgrading to a regular free account](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/06/16/changes-to-kubernetes-slack-2025/).  Not only does this [change how we use Slack](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md), community members [need to take action](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon) to preserve some things that are not part of regular backups.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, June 20**

Hopefully everyone has their PRRs started, and this Friday is the deadline for [opt-in for Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze).  Get your 1.34 changes listed.

Patches for all supported versions are also due this week.

## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP 2837: Pod Level Resource Specifications](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2837-pod-level-resource-spec/README.md)

The KEP extended the Pod API to support Pod-level resource limits and requests for non-extended resources in addition to existing container-level resource allocation. Previously, resource requests and limits could be set only at the container level, which limited flexibility and ease of resource management for the pod as a whole. The existing behaviour was problematic for users who wanted to limit the overall resource consumption of the entire pod.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
