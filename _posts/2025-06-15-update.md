## Developer News

Kubernetes Slack is [downgrading to a regular free account](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/06/16/changes-to-kubernetes-slack-2025/).  Not only does this [change how we use Slack](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md), community members [need to take action](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon) to preserve some things that are not part of regular backups.

The Go team fixed [a symlink race condition in `os.RemoveAll`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/132267) in Go versions 1.21.11 and 1.22.4. The Kubernetes Security Response Committee confirmed this vulnerability can allow file deletion on a Node. This issue will be fixed in the [patch releases coming out on Wednesday](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/J5ZVEm99ICE)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, June 20**

Hopefully everyone has their PRRs started, and this Friday is the deadline for [opt-in for Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze).  Get your 1.34 changes listed.

[Kubernetes v1.34.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md) has been built and pushed. Please review the changes and test the release.

Patch releases are due out on June 18th.

## Featured PRs

[132007: Fix: HPA suppresses FailedRescale event on successful conflict retry](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132007)

This PR modifies the HPA controller to only emit a FailedRescale event if a scaling operation fails after retrying due to a conflict; If the retry succeeds, it will emit a SuccessfulRescale event instead. This change ensures that transient conflicts do not generate unnecessary failure events and reduces noise in the event logs.

[132251: kubectl delete: update interactive delete to break on new line](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132251)

This PR updates kubectl delete interactive mode to treat an empty newline as “No”. Previously, pressing “Enter” on an empty line would send a new line. With this update, pressing “Enter” now automatically responds with “No”, improving safety and ensuring that empty inputs don’t result in unintended actions.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 2837: Pod Level Resource Specifications](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2837-pod-level-resource-spec/README.md)

The KEP extends the Pod API to support Pod-level resource limits and requests for non-extended resources in addition to existing container-level resource allocation. Previously, resource requests and limits could be set only at the container level, which limited flexibility and ease of resource management for the pod as a whole. The existing behaviour was problematic for users who wanted to limit the overall resource consumption of the entire pod.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
