## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog Freeze, October 30**

We are in the countdown to Code Freeze and this week is full of deadlines.  Finish your feature blog entries by October 30, followed by any major deprecations/removals by November 4, with Code and Test Freeze on November 8th.

## Featured PRs

### [125258 Etcd Kubernetes interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125258)

Introduces the alpha version of [a defined interface for Kubernetes-etcd communications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nIpoW87qqQ9FxINOzXPkhu7CD_FWW1piYqHZDr39nU/edit).  The interface will improve tests and reliability as well as permitting (but not implementing) alternate backends. It covers data storage and leases.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 784: Kube Proxy component configuration graduation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/784-kube-proxy-component-config)

The KEP proposes automatic deletion of "Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)" associated with StatefulSets upon their deletion or scale-down. It introduces a `PersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` field, allowing users to opt-in for PVC deletion. This enhancement aims to simplify resource management, while preserving application state during regular operations.

This KEP is tracked for stable release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
