## Developer News

Kubelet node IP address assignment is still "fragile and broken," with [yet another PR this week](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125337).  As such, Antonio Ojea would like people who work on external cloud providers to [weigh in on a long-term solution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqdVLQHIYjrzjy8Hq-FMysthHRL7ht0guk2uWI0FxKM/edit#heading=h.97ewrhxwu05m).

SIG-Etcd and SIG-Cluster Lifecycle [have proposed a new Etcd Operator WG](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/L1TgHxIkW_o) in order to create one.

The [call for session proposals](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/schedule/) for the Contributor Summit in Salt Lake City is open.  This includes proposals for presentations, demos, discussions, workshops, and SIG/team meetings; really, anything that should go on the KCS schedule except for the Doc Sprints (which are already there).  [Submit](https://forms.gle/JFPpZ2AnCRRhbwQ6A) before September 15.
