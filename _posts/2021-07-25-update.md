## Developer News

Planning for the [2021 Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcsna2021/), which will be held in Los Angeles and online on October 11th, has begun. While the program will be mostly [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), the committee will solicit a few scheduled talks and workshops. If you have something to teach other contributors, let them know during registration in August.  Also, the Summit team could [use volunteers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5874#issuecomment-882221751) to help with content and logistics; if you're available, please add your name to that issue or ask on #ContribEx in slack.

fejta-bot has [been retired in favor of k8s-triage-robot](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/oD_ijk7jpa8), who will hereafter be the automated voice to tell you when you've forgotten to tag a SIG in your PR.

Rodrigo Campos has shared [a proposal to use a DAG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ker0cm6n3auAy_lYmvthilhTxF8OVisjl_52nTQJBE/edit) for sidecar startup ordering, for comment.

If you're a Helm user, you need to update your install ASAP to [avoid a credential-exposing security hole](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs complete, July 27th**

We're in the home stretch, and hopefully you've already merged your final documentation PR comments.  Release notes will be completed this Thursday, hopefully for a release on August 4.  But ... first [we need to debug some test fails and flakes](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/F3Mpjv2ximM). While things have improved from last week, there's 5 flaky jobs in [1.22-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.22-blocking) and six critical [test fail](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Ffailing-test+label%3Apriority%2Fcritical-urgent+) and [test flake issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fflake+label%3Apriority%2Fcritical-urgent).  So please respond quickly to any messages from CI so that we can get 1.22 out on time.

Also, [1.22rc0 is out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), so please test on your own infra.

With 1.22 almost done, it's [time to select a 1.23 team](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/1qhV3s9pvKw); if you wanted to try out being part of the Kubernetes release, shadowing is the way to start.

## Featured Discussion

### [community#5724: Introduce documentation about managing a separate mount namespace](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5724)

A new design sketch from SIG-Node would allow running containers in their own mount namespace, distinct from the host system. This is interesting both from a performance standpoint, as the current mount structures can cause high CPU usage from systemd, but also for security. Specifically this would likely have proactively mitigated the recently discovered [CVE-2021-33909 aka Sequoia](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2021/07/20/sequoia-a-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-linuxs-filesystem-layer-cve-2021-33909). If you have any comments or thoughts on topic, please comment on the proposal or reach out to SIG-Node.
