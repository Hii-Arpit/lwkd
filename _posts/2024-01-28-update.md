## Featured PR

### [#122886: [CEL Library] Unstructured Object Construction Support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122886)

As CEL support has been added in more and more places throughout Kubernetes, one feature we've not yet had is the ability to construct whole new deeply-nested objects in CEL expressions. This PR adds support for a syntax similar to Go structs which works in CEL:

```
Object{
    spec: Object.spec{
        replicas: 3
    }
}
```

Currently this can only be used to creating non-schema-enforcing Unstructureds however the plan is to add schema checks using OpenAPI data in the future. Look forward to more support functions being added for using and manipulating these objects too!
