## Developer News

Benjamin Elder is [implementing a policy of not re-triaging some issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/32957); [comment on the PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/34321).

We're [promoting several Kind-based test jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/2740) to release-blocking, since they've shown themselves to be reliable and able to catch real issues.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze and Test Freeze March 21**

We're on our final approach to Code Freeze.  Topics for the Feature Blog were frozen this week.   Time to wrap up your work for 1.33.

March patch release cherry-picks are due this Friday.

## Featured PRs

[130349: Declarative Validation: Add validation generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130349)

This PR kicks off the implementation of **Declarative Validation** in Kubernetes
by introducing `validation-gen`, a code generator that automatically produces
validation logic based on structured `//+` tags in `types.go` files. The validation
system is modular, with a core set of built-in validation rules, and future PRs
will expand it with additional plugins like `dnsName`, `enum`, and `union`.
This PR also includes a robust test suite to ensure correctness across various
validation scenarios.
