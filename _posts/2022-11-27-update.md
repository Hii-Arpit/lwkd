## Developer News

Maintainer Session submissions for KubeCon Amsterdam are now open.  If you are a SIG Lead or CNCF project maintainer, you should have received a link for proposals.  Now's the time to meet with your SIG and figure out what you want to do.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Notes Complete, December 2nd**

We are so close to 1.26!  There's the release notes to finish up and release blog, and then we should release the new version on December 6th.

That's assuming that all failing tests stay fixed, of course!  Right now [boards are green](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.26-blocking), but pay attention to your GitHub notifications and respond quickly to [failed test bugs](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/views/19).  Many thanks to Wojciech Tyczynski, Patrick Ohly, and everyone else who contributed to the massive testing refactor this year.

The cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is also December 2nd.
