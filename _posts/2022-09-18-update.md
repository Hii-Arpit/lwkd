## Developer News

Two security reports this week: [CVE-2022-3172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112513), which allows aggregated API servers to misdirect traffic and steal credentials, and [CVE-2021-25749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112192), which can let users deploy Windows container workloads as Administrator.  Both issues are fixed in the latest patch releases. Note that the patch for CVE-2022-3172 blocks all 300ish responses, so test after upgrading and be prepared to set `--aggregator-reject-forwarding-redirect` if your API server uses redirects.

Votes for the [2022 Steering Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2022) are due September 29th.  Please [vote now](https://elections.k8s.io/)!

The [Contributor Summit CfP](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2022/kcsna/cfp/) is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Review, September 29th**

Have your draft KEPs ready for the PRR team by next Thursday, and final versions opted-in by October 6th. Current [CI signal is green](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/G7ZHYRpVt4A).

Patch releases for [1.25.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) came out last week.  In addition to the above security issues, these patches fix a large number of bugs discovered during 1.25 Code Freeze and backported, as well as [updating Go for all versions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112322).

## Featured PR

### [#111333: Add auth API to get self subject attributes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111333)

For a long time, the `TokenReview` API under `authentication/v1` has allowed getting the user details from a cluster JWT, such as a ServiceAccount token. This allowed checking the source of credentials from another party but not for yourself. The newly added `SelfSubjectReview` provides this capability. This allows any user to confirm what user information kube-apiserver sees for them, both for debugging user configurations with the new `kubectl auth whoami` or server-side plugin configuration issues. Check it out if you have any automated troubleshooting tools or self-diagnostic systems.
