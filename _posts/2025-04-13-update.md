All of the current SIG Scheduling leads [are stepping down](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/HV2r0N8hKxQ).  They have nominated chairs Kensei Nakada and Maciej Skoczeń and TLs Kensei Nakada and Dominik Marciński to take their places.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release day, 23 April**

We are currently in **Code Freeze**.

Kubernetes [v1.33.0-rc.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md) is now avaliable for testing.

Due to the Release Managers' availability and a conflict with the v1.33.0-rc.1 release, the April 2025 patch releases have been postponed to the next week (Tuesday, April 22).

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 1769: Memory Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1769-memory-manager)

This KEP defined the Memory Manager, which has enabled guaranteed memory and hugepages allocation for pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. It supports both single-NUMA and multi-NUMA strategies, ensuring memory is allocated from the minimal number of NUMA nodes. The component provides NUMA affinity hints to the Topology Manager to support optimal pod placement. While single-NUMA is a special case of multi-NUMA, both strategies are described to highlight different use cases.

This KEP was [implemented in Kubernetes 1.32](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/13/memory-manager-goes-ga/).
