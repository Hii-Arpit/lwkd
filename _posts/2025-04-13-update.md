## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 1769: Memory Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1769-memory-manager)

This KEP proposes the Memory Manager, which enables guaranteed memory and hugepages allocation for pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. It supports both single-NUMA and multi-NUMA strategies, ensuring memory is allocated from the minimal number of NUMA nodes. The component provides NUMA affinity hints to the Topology Manager to support optimal pod placement. While single-NUMA is a special case of multi-NUMA, both strategies are described to highlight different use cases.

This KEP is targeted for stable graduation in the Kubernetes 1.32 release cycle.
