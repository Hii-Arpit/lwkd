## Featured PRs

[51630: Add Hugo Segments for Faster Local Website Builds](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/51630)

This PR introduces support for Hugo segments, allowing users to render specific parts of the Kubernetes website locally; For example, the build can be limited to English (en) or Persian (fa) content instead of rendering the entire site; This significantly reduces build time and resource usage when previewing documentation changes.

The default method `make container-serve` continues to build the whole site. 

To build a specific segment, users can use the following commands 
```bash
make container-serve segments=en     # To build individual segments
make container-serve segments=en,fa  # To build multiple segments
```

[131700: Add Support for CEL Extended Lists Library](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131700)

This PR adds the support for using CEL extended lists library in Kubernetes by integrating upstream support from cel-go. This adds new list functions that allow more advanced list operations in CEL expressions. These functions can improve how conditions are written in features that use CEL-based evaluation, such as admission control and validations.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5080: Ordered Namespace Deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5080-ordered-namespace-deletion/README.md)

This KEP introduces a secure and deterministic mechanism for deleting Kubernetes namespaces. The motivation comes from security and operational concerns with the current semi-random deletion orderâ€”for example, pods might continue running after their protecting NetworkPolicy is removed. This KEP ensures that all pods are deleted first and only then are the remaining resources removed, reducing the risk of exposed workloads. It is implemented through a feature gate `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` that enforces this opinionated deletion order during namespace cleanup.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34
