## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5080: Ordered Namespace Deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5080-ordered-namespace-deletion/README.md)

This KEP introduces a secure and deterministic mechanism for deleting Kubernetes namespaces. The motivation comes from security and operational concerns with the current semi-random deletion orderâ€”for example, pods might continue running after their protecting NetworkPolicy is removed. This KEP ensures that all pods are deleted first and only then are the remaining resources removed, reducing the risk of exposed workloads. It is implemented through a feature gate `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` that enforces this opinionated deletion order during namespace cleanup.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34
