## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 3633: Introduce MatchLabelKeys and MismatchLabelKeys to PodAffinity and PodAntiAffinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/3633-matchlabelkeys-to-podaffinity)

This KEP introduces `MatchLabelKeys` and `MismatchLabelKeys` to `PodAffinityTerm` to enhance scheduling nuances during pod upgrades. Its goal is to improve the scheduler's ability to distinguish between old and new pod versions, addressing the issues of improper affinity adherence and optimizing node placement, especially during rolling updates in saturated or idle clusters.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
