## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with a demo of [CRI-O](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o) supporting Kubernetes 1.10 by Antonio Murdaca.  He showed off the alternate runtime, and then discussed whether SIG-Node would move to it as the default (answer: depends on test coverage).

Steve Wong introduced [SIG-VMWare](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-vmware), a new SIG working on Kubernetes compatibility with VMware & VSphere.  They had there first meeting and published their charter last month.  [SIG-Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows), explained by Michael Michael, has been busy since 1.9 improving support for Windows containers, including resources, file system stats, Flexv, isolation, and e2e testing.  They hope for a stable release to coincide with Windows Server 2019.  Former SIG On-Prem has announced that they are demoting themselves from a SIG to a Workgroup/discussion forum.

Test-Infra is [disabling the cherrypick-auto-approve munger bot](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/Br2-4pQPOIs/YbSM1YNIBgAJ), because nobody ever understood how it worked.  Brian Grant, on behalf of the Steering Committee, said they were working on charters, with 6 in process, and explaining sub-projects to SIGs.  Finally, Dan Kohn demoed the new [CNCF interactive landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: Feature Freeze, May 24th.*

This was [week 2 of 12](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md) for 1.11.  SIGs need to add their features to the [features repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.11) and the [feature tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16N9KSlxWwxUA2gV6jvuW9N8tPRHzNhu1-RYY4Y0RZLs/edit?ouid=103000293055760527954&usp=sheets_home&ths=true). The release team also discussed [a plan for shortening Code Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md#conditionally-shortening-code-freeze) if all tests are passing by May 18th.

Kubernetes 1.10.1 patch release came out on Friday.
