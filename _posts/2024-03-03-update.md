### [#122717: KEP-4358: Custom Resource Field Selectors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122717)

Selectors in Kubernetes have long been a way to limit large API calls like List and Watch, requesting things with only specific labels or similar. In operators this can be very important to reduce memory usage of shared informer caches, as well as generally keeping apiserver load down. Some core objects extended selectors beyond labels, allowing filtering on other fields such as listing Pods based on `spec.nodeName`. But this set of fields was limited and could feel random if you didn't know the specific history of the API (e.g. Pods need a node name filter because it's the main request made by the kubelet). And it wasn't available at all to custom type. This PR expands the system, allowing each custom type to declare selector-able fields which will be checked and indexed automatically. The declaration uses JSONPath in a very similar way to the `additionalPrinterColumns` feature:

```yaml
selectableFields:
- jsonPath: .spec.color
- jsonPath: .spec.size
```

These can then be used in the API just like any other field selector:

```go
c.List(context.Background(), &redThings, client.MatchingFields{
	"spec.color": "red",
})
```

As an alpha feature, this is behind the `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` feature gate.
