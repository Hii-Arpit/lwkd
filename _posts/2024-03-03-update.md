## Developer News

All CI jobs [must be on K8s community infra](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/p6PAML90ZOU) as of yesterday.  While the infra team will migrate ones that are simple, other jobs that you don't help them move may be deleted.  Update your jobs now.

[Monitoring dashboards](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/KCo5xHQRLSE) for the [GKE](https://monitoring-gke.prow.k8s.io/?orgId=1) and [EKS](https://monitoring-eks.prow.k8s.io/) build clusters are live. Also, there was an [outage in EKS jobs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMgbClhYwIls8NdEw2jE80OqHmnD-Ty7TermtUe4MTE/edit#heading=h.614q085kkezh) last week.

After a year of work led by Tim Hockin, Go Workspaces support for hacking on Kubernetes [is now available](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/HjYciF1AJgI), eliminating a lot of GOPATH pain.

It's time to start working on your [SIG Annual Reports](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/kAdMGywyFMs), which you should find a lot shorter and easier than previous years.  Note that you don't have to be the SIG Chair to do these, they just have to review them.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze, March 27th**

Code Freeze is [now in effect](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Y1EJ1HGBPJk/m/mSMClkn4AwAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer). If your KEP did not get tracked and you want to get your KEP shipped in the 1.30 release, please [file an exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) as soon as possible.

March Cherry Pick deadline for patch releases is the 8th.

## Featured PRs

### [#122717: KEP-4358: Custom Resource Field Selectors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122717)

Selectors in Kubernetes have long been a way to limit large API calls like List and Watch, requesting things with only specific labels or similar. In operators this can be very important to reduce memory usage of shared informer caches, as well as generally keeping apiserver load down. Some core objects extended selectors beyond labels, allowing filtering on other fields such as listing Pods based on `spec.nodeName`. But this set of fields was limited and could feel random if you didn't know the specific history of the API (e.g. Pods need a node name filter because it's the main request made by the kubelet). And it wasn't available at all to custom type. This PR expands the system, allowing each custom type to declare selector-able fields which will be checked and indexed automatically. The declaration uses JSONPath in a very similar way to the `additionalPrinterColumns` feature:

```yaml
selectableFields:
- jsonPath: .spec.color
- jsonPath: .spec.size
```

These can then be used in the API just like any other field selector:

```go
c.List(context.Background(), &redThings, client.MatchingFields{
	"spec.color": "red",
})
```

As an alpha feature, this is behind the `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` feature gate.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-1610: Container Resource based Autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-autoscaling/1610-container-resource-autoscaling/README.md)

For scaling pods based on resource usage, the HPA currently calculates the sum of all the individual container's resource usage. This is not suitable for workloads where the containers are not related to each other. This KEP proposes that the HPA also provide an option to scale pods based on the resource usages of individual containers in a Pod. The KEP proposes adding a new `ContainerResourceMetricSource` metric source, with a new `Container` field, which will be used to identify the container for which the resources should be tracked. When there are multiple containers in a Pod, the individual resource usages of each container can change at different rates. Adding a way to specify the target gives more fine grained control over the scaling.

This KEP is in beta since v1.27 and is planned to graduate to stable in v1.30.
