## Shoutouts

* Michelle Nguyen -- A big shout-out to Kubernetes v1.34 :of-wind-and-will-party: Docs team! @Rashan @Urvashi @Arvind Parekh @YuJen Huang(Dylan) @DangerBuff
  You all consistently went above and beyondâ€”whether updating meeting notes meticulously, tracking down docs, or supporting each other with krel tasks. 
  Every single person delivered exceptional work without fail. Thanks to you all, our release was smooth, especially from a docs perspective!
  A special shoutout to @Drew Hagen for helping Docs out during Docs Freeze. You absolutely rock! I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished as a team and am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work alongside everyone.
* Drew Hagen -- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge @Matteo (away until Jan 2026) for the seriously impressive leadership of a newer release branch management shadow program for the 1.34 release, and all the amazing work putting together strong documentation for branch management!! :extreme-teamwork:
  I remember my experience releasing alpha 3 being very clear what to do and going really smooth. Very little tribal knowledge. And we did most releases async, which I think speaks to how strong this handbook is. I thank you for still being around to observe and help, even if it meant some later nights in your time zone. :keanu_thanks:
  @xmudrii @jimangel Great work! Y'all have set the foundation for many more cycles to come. Thank you for all of your patience, guidance and support. 
  It was really great learning and working with you all @Angelos Kolaitis @satyampsoni
