## Shoutouts

* Drew Hagen -- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge @Matteo for the seriously impressive leadership of a newer release branch management shadow program for the 1.34 release, and all the amazing work putting together strong documentation for branch management!!
  I remember my experience releasing alpha 3 being very clear what to do and going really smooth. Very little tribal knowledge. And we did most releases async, which I think speaks to how strong this handbook is. I thank you for still being around to observe and help, even if it meant some later nights in your time zone.
  @xmudrii @jimangel Great work! Y'all have set the foundation for many more cycles to come. Thank you for all of your patience, guidance and support. 
  It was really great learning and working with you all @Angelos Kolaitis @satyampsoni
