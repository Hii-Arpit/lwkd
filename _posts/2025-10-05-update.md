## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 16**

All enhancements are expected to have met the [requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) by the freeze. Those that don't meet the requirements will be removed from the milestone and will require an [Exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

Kubernetes v1.35.0-alpha.1 is out!

The cherry-pick deadline for patch releases is Oct 10.

## Steering Committee Election

The [Steering Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) [Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2025#voting-process) voting ends on [Friday, 24th October, AoE](https://dateful.com/convert/anywhere-on-earth-aoe?t=1159pm&d=2025-10-24). You can check your eligibility to vote [in the voting app](https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/steering---2025), and file an exception request by October 22 if you need an exception. Don't forget to cast your votes if you haven't already!

## Featured PRs

[133697: Codify feature gate dependencies](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133697)

With this PR, feature gate dependencies can be explicitly declared and enforced. This has been ad-hoc or implicit in the past. Components will now refuse to start if a feature is enabled without its required dependencies. Feature Owners should review [the backfilled dependencies](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133912), while users who manually toggle feature gates must ensure dependent features are also enabledâ€”especially noting that `AllAlpha=true` now requires `AllBeta=true` or equivalent beta features to be set.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 859: Include kubectl command metadata in http request headers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-cli/859-kubectl-headers)

This KEP aims to add extra HTTP headers to kubectl requests sent to the Kubernetes apiserver. These headers would share details such as which kubectl command was used, the flags included, a session ID, and whether the command is deprecated. This would help cluster administrators understand how users interact with the cluster, making it easier to debug issues, track usage, and gather insights, without exposing any sensitive data.

This KEP is tracked for GA in v1.35

## Other Merges

* Disable [SchedulerAsyncAPICalls](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134400) feature gate to prevent scheduler performance issues under high API server load.
* Add [path normalization](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134368) to error matcher for improved field validation.
* DeviceClass now enforces a maximum of [32 selectors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134302) and configs via declarative validation.
* Add [declarative validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134211) +k8s:maxItems tag to ResourceClaim
* HPA controller now exposes [desired_replicas](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134295) metric to track scaling history.
* Fix [preemptor pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134294) behavior to prevent endless scheduling loops during slow victim deletion.
* Feature gate [dependencies are now explicit](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133697) and validated at startup, preventing enabling a feature if its dependencies are disabled.
* kube-scheduler introduces lightweight [AssumeCache in VolumeBinding plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133929) to fix occasional pod scheduling delays.

## Shoutouts

* Drew Hagen -- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge @Matteo for the seriously impressive leadership of a newer release branch management shadow program for the 1.34 release, and all the amazing work putting together strong documentation for branch management!!
  I remember my experience releasing alpha 3 being very clear what to do and going really smooth. Very little tribal knowledge. And we did most releases async, which I think speaks to how strong this handbook is. I thank you for still being around to observe and help, even if it meant some later nights in your time zone.
  @xmudrii @jimangel Great work! Y'all have set the foundation for many more cycles to come. Thank you for all of your patience, guidance and support. 
  It was really great learning and working with you all @Angelos Kolaitis @satyampsoni
