## Featured PRs

[133097: Resolve confusing use of TooManyRequests error for eviction](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133097)

This PR resolves an issue where pod eviction requests could return a `TooManyRequests` (429) error with an unrelated disruption budget message; The API server now reports a clearer error when eviction is blocked by the fail-safe mechanism in the `DisruptionController`, avoiding misleading responses.

[133742: Remove GA feature gate ComponentSLIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133742)

This PR cleans up the codebase by removing the `ComponentSLIs` feature gate. The feature has been stable since Kubernetes `v1.29`, so the gate is no longer needed; With this change, the functionality remains available, but without an unnecessary toggle.

[133890: Fix missing kubelet_volume_stats_* metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133890)

This PR fixes a regression in `v1.34` where `kubelet_volume_stats_* metrics` disappeared from the kubelet metrics endpoint; The bug was caused by multiple calls to `Register()`; The fix ensures the metrics are registered correctly and reported again.
