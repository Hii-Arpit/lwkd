## Featured PRs

[133097: Resolve confusing use of TooManyRequests error for eviction](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133097)

This PR resolves an issue where pod eviction requests could return a `TooManyRequests` (429) error with an unrelated disruption budget message; The API server now reports a clearer error when eviction is blocked by the fail-safe mechanism in the `DisruptionController`, avoiding misleading responses.

[133890: Fix missing kubelet_volume_stats_* metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133890)

This PR fixes a regression in `v1.34` where `kubelet_volume_stats_* metrics` disappeared from the kubelet metrics endpoint; The bug was caused by multiple calls to `Register()`; The fix ensures the metrics are registered correctly and reported again.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 740: Support external signing of service account tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/740-service-account-external-signing/README.md)

This KEP enables Kubernetes to integrate with external key management solutions such as HSMs and cloud KMS for signing service account tokens. It supports out-of-process JWT signing and dynamic public key discovery, improving security and allowing key rotation without restarting kube-apiserver. Existing file-based key management remains supported as a fallback.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
