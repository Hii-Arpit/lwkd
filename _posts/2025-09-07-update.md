## KEP of the Week

[KEP 740: Support external signing of service account tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/740-service-account-external-signing/README.md)

This KEP enables Kubernetes to integrate with external key management solutions such as HSMs and cloud KMS for signing service account tokens. It supports out-of-process JWT signing and dynamic public key discovery, improving security and allowing key rotation without restarting kube-apiserver. Existing file-based key management remains supported as a fallback.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
