## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.28 Released, August 15**

We are still on schedule to release 1.28 this week.  But, that means that if any issue around this release is assigned to you, you need to respond immediately.

Patch releases have been [delayed until August 23rd](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/0ku-CI--1vc) due to conflicts with the 1.28 release schedule.
