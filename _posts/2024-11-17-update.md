## Developer News

KubeCon NA Salt Lake City was last week! The Kubernetes Contributor Summit was held on Monday, November 11th. Find the photos and meeting notes from the unconference discussions [here](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/).

When one Kubecon ends, another one starts: [the CfP is open](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/#call-for-proposals) for the Maintainer Summit at Kubecon London.  The Summit includes the Kubernetes Contributor Summit plus collaboration with other projects.  CfPs for [Kubecon Main Track](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp/) and [Colo Events](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cncf-hosted-co-located-events-overview/) are open as well.  And if you're going to be in Kubecon India, don't skip the [Maintainer Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/program/maintainer-summit/) there.

There have been some updates to SIG leadership. [Richa Banker](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/UMZ6c_gBtzc) is nominated as the new chair for SIG Instrumentation and [Marko MudriniÄ‡](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/NukAmsVSmNc) is nominated as a Tech Lead for SIG K8S Infra. Congratulations and thank you for all your work!
