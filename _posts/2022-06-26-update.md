## Developer News

The Ingress-NGINX project is [pausing accepting new features](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/rxtrKvT_Q8E) and spending the next season working on stability.  While they're doing that, if you are an Ingress-NGINX user, please [fill out their survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ingressngx2022) and help decide what features to prioritize when they start up again.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions Due July 25th**

We are now in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/qbHV81RWvq0); file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) if you just missed the deadline. There are 55 tracked features for the release. Another 21 were removed because of incomplete KEPs.

The first 1.25 Alpha [is available](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md).  Built with Golang 1.18.3, it includes few of the features that will eventually be in 1.25.0.

Cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is July 8th, so if you're OOO for the American holiday, get those PRs done now.

## Featured PRs

### [enhancements#3392: KEP-3104: Introduce kuberc](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3392)

The venerable and often-frustrating "kubeconfig" file has served as the primary configuration mechanism for `kubectl` for a long time. This has offered a lot of flexibility to users managing multiple clusters, with features like PATH-style lookup and file merging, but these features have also made it difficult to add user-centric preferences to `kubectl`, detached from cluster configuration details. SIG-CLI is proposing a new file, `kuberc`, which would contain only user preferences and nothing related to cluster data. Some initial proposed use cases include allowing user-configured aliases to abbreviate common commands and persistent overrides for the default value of a value such as making `kubectl apply` use `--server-side=true` unless overridden.

### [enhancements#3377: KEP-1027: API Unions for 1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3377)

This KEP has been brewing for many years but 1.25 will hopefully see a renewed push with a more detailed plan. The overall idea is to expose `oneOf` validation for custom resource types, for cases like volume configuration on pods where there's many substructs and exactly one must be used. Currently this behavior can only be implemented with a validation webhook (or perhaps a CEL expression if you're on the bleeding edge) but as it is an extremely common thing in Kubernetes schemas, it will be nice to have as a full OpenAPI validation feature.

## Other Merges

* Automatic Volume force detach [only happens on unhealthy nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110721)
* EndpointSlices will [poll for readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110639) instead of getting stuck if their Node isn't ready
* Don't output help text [whenever Kubelet fails to start](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110728)
* `reflect.Pointer` is the [new `reflect.Ptr`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110788)
* Better [debug attach failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110764) error messages
* Make sure FiberChannel Volumes [attach to the right disk](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110719)
* `--chunk-size` with a selector [returns the right number of pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110652)
* Added [owner reference auto-deletion test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110612) for StatefulSets as a prerequisite to implementing the [StatefulSet PVC AutoDeletion feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/1847-autoremove-statefulset-pvcs)
* As a first-time contribution, @LY-today [fixed an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110425) where client-go gets stuck in an error cycle after evicting a pod
* Support load balancer ["pinhole" firewalling](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109510)
* Kubeadm: [`cert-dir`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110709), [CoreDNS anti-affinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110593)

## Promotions

* [CSIMigration is GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110410); anyone still using in-tree storage drivers should prepare to migrate them to CSI when 1.25 comes out
* Supporting this, [CSIMigrationPortworx is beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110411)
* [Key Management Service API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110201) advances to v2alpha1

## Deprecated

* kubectl drops [multiple pod-auto-deletion flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110668), since none of them ever functioned; kubectl will also error if a pod doesn't terminate with `--rm`

## Version Updates

* [python-client 24.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/releases/tag/v24.2.0)
* [runc to 1.1.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110496)
