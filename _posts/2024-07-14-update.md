## Developer News

[Maintainer session proposals](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-opportunities/) for Kubecon are due this Sunday.  Write one for your SIG now.  Don't miss the deadline!  

The Contributor Summit is looking for contributors [to design the swag and the award](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/14Rb3Z5a3rU). Also, proposals for the Summit are [still open](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/schedule/).

Subprojects [kpng](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5054) and [etcdadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5013) are being archived.  If you still use [etcd-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/etcd-manager), it's in a new repo owned by SIG-Etcd.

A security issue with Kubernetes clusters running Windows, [CVE-2024-5321, has been reported](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/4heKf7NU4CE). This vulnerability lets users with incorrect permissions read and modify container logs.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, July 24th**

Code freeze is happening in a week! If your KEP is opted in for the v1.31 release, make sure to get your PRs merged in time before the deadline.

Kubernetes [v1.27.16](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/O4xZjqxsuOM), [v1.28.12](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/b_pKyClWmoA), [v1.29.7](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/KQt7sILSKtw) and [v1.30.3](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hGN3zEeaPg8) patch releases are now live!

## Featured PR

### [#125868: Add --for=create option to kubectl wait](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125868)

After a few false starts, we are trying again to support a "wait for create" mechanism for `kubectl wait`. The new `--for` option will allow pluggable wait conditions beyond the original "wait for delete" and new "wait for create" (or really "wait for exists"). This can already help streamline shell scripts, and talk to SIG-CLI if you're interested in proposing additional modes!

## KEP of the Week

### [4633: Only allow Anonymous Auth for configured endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/4633-anonymous-auth-configurable-endpoints)

Allowing anonymous authentication against all or most Kubernetes endpoints can be [a huge security hole](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2tp/rbacdoors-how-cryptominers-are-exploiting-rbac-misconfigs-greg-castle-vinayak-goyal-google) but is easy to do if you make mistakes with RBAC.  This KEP implements a way to disable anonymous auth for all endpoints except a specificed list (usually healthz, readyz, and livez).  This will close a lot of runtime security holes.

4633 was introduced by Vinayak Goyal in May, and is expected to be Alpha in 1.31.
