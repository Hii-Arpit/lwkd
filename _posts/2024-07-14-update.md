### [#125868: Add --for=create option to kubectl wait](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125868)

After a few false starts, we are trying again to support a "wait for create" mechanism for `kubectl wait`. The new `--for` option will allow pluggable wait conditions beyond the original "wait for delete" and new "wait for create" (or really "wait for exists"). This can already help streamline shell scripts, and talk to SIG-CLI if you're interested in proposing additional modes!
