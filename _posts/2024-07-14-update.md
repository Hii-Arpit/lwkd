## Developer News

[Maintainer session proposals](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-opportunities/) for Kubecon are due this Sunday.  Write one for your SIG now.  Don't miss the deadline!  

The Contributor Summit is looking for contributors [to design the swag and the award](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/14Rb3Z5a3rU). Also, proposals for the Summit are [still open](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/schedule/).

Subprojects [kpng](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5054) and [etcdadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5013) are being archived.  If you still use [etcd-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/etcd-manager), it's in a new repo owned by SIG-Etcd.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:**

## KEP of the Week

### [4633: Only allow Anonymous Auth for configured endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/4633-anonymous-auth-configurable-endpoints)

Allowing anonymous authentication against all or most Kubernetes endpoints can be [a huge security hole](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2tp/rbacdoors-how-cryptominers-are-exploiting-rbac-misconfigs-greg-castle-vinayak-goyal-google) but is easy to do if you make mistakes with RBAC.  This KEP implements a way to disable anonymous auth for all endpoints except a specificed list (usually healthz, readyz, and livez).  This will close a lot of runtime security holes.

4633 was introduced by Vinayak Goyal in May, and is expected to be Alpha in 1.31.
