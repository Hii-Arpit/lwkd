## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4601: Authorize with Field and Label Selectors](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/4601-authorize-with-selectors)

This KEP extends Kubernetes authorization attributes to include field and label selectors for `List`, `Watch`, and `DeleteCollection` verbs, allowing authorizers to make more granular security decisions. This enables out-of-tree authorizers to experiment with restrictions based on selectors, improving per-node workload security. Additionally, field and label selectors will be added to webhook authorization types, Subject Access Reviews (SSAR, SAR, Local SAR), and the node authorizer (restricting by `nodeName`), and will be integrated into the CEL authorizer for more advanced policy evaluations.

This KEP is tracked for alpha release in v1.32.
