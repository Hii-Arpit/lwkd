## Featured PR

### [#115813: Introduce controller aliases for KCM and CCM](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115813)

Individual controllers hosted inside kube-controller-manager and cloud-controller-manager make up much of the functionality of Kubernetes. As they have built up over time, loose standards emerged for naming them, but to preserve compatibility we've always left the old, strange names. Until now! This PR fully regularizes the naming for controllers following the `something-something-controller` pattern. But to maintain compat, there's a new alias system so that existing command lines involving `--controllers` or similar will work as expected. That said, compatibility is a tricky beast at times, if you were doing things like log analysis then you may want to update to the newer names or use any of the rich data available with the newer log output formats added over the past few releases. Overall this hopefully simplifies things across the community and gives us an enforceable standard moving forward!
