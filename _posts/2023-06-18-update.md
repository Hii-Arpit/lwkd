## Developer News

Rita Zhang of SIG-Security has found and patched [two security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118640) in ImagePolicy webhooks and ServiceAccount.  Tim Allclair also [found a vulnerability in seccomp](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118690). Might wanna apply those patch updates as soon as you can.

Michael Morris has [stepped down](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/RsJhn38f9TA) as co-lead of Gateway API GAMMA.

The community is brainstorming designs for a [new contributor badge](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/265) for registered Kubernetes contributors; design help wanted.

Reminder: please [migrate your Prow jobs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/H5-G2bQGgds) to the new cluster.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exception Requests Due, July 10th**

We are in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/xzFXaPZb2dU) with 67 Enhancements on the [tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/140/views/1?filterQuery=status%3ATracked). That hasn't stopped the call for exceptions, though, with four already submitted.

Patch releases [1.27.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md)(yes, already), [1.26.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md), [1.25.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) came out last week.  These include important security updates (see above).  Note that next month's patch release will be the last for version 1.24, so maybe start thinking about upgrading.

## Merges
