## Developer News

We are in Code Freeze.

Kubernetes is [migrating to EasyCLA](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/6XBg5EJdUyQ) for CLA-signing in mid-August.  For most folks, this will be an invisible change, but [a few people](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2778#issuecomment-873123394) will need to re-sign due to missing info in their original CLA.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze July 15**

We are now in [Code Freeze](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Q_vs153Wicw).  Any further feature work for 1.22 requires filing an Exception and having it granted, and a bunch of folks already have.  Any non-bugfix changes to tests need to be in by the 15th, and your docs need to be complete by the 20th.  So, hopefully you're not reading this on PTO.

If you have a failing test job, or a feature that needs an exception, or any release-related particular issue, consider attending the [Daily Burndown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l7Hz4Ee9YrBPCP-MelhzK36T2OGZip4V-q39vR36Bwc/edit) so that you can coordinate with the Release Team directly.

[1.22 Beta 1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) is downloadable, please test.

Patch releases for all supported versions are due out this Wednesday.

## Merges

* Nodes can now support [using swap memory](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102823) for Pods, a huge boon to database geeks and Java programmers
* [Memory Quality-Of-Service](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102970) can be specified on Nodes with cGroups v2
* [Prevent a whole set of race conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102344) in terminating pods that are busy starting up through a pretty substantial change in how we decide which pods are ready to be shut down
* If your Endpoint has more than 1000 addresses you're probably doing something wrong, and more importantly [it will be truncated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103520)
* Run your [kubelet in a User Namespace](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92863) and ignore errors for things that require root access
* Allow Scheduler plugins to [manually move pods to the active queue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103383)
* `kubectl replace` for services [no longer requires](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103532) users to copy all fields before updating them
* You don't have to [follow every YAML separator with a blank line anymore](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103457)
* PodDisruptionBudget [can cope with umanaged pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103414)
* Make sure that PodIPs are [reported as the same value everywhere](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103307)
* PVCs have an alpha [DataSourceRef field](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103276), helping support nonstandard data sources
* `kubectl describe quota` [gets consistent](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102177) about units
* Make sure [all terminating pods are gracefully terminated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100101) turing a graceful termination
* The API will now take an [Impersonate-UID header](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99961) to complete the suite of incognito containers
* Jobs no longer [waits on Pods to terminate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98238), and you can watch them finish up via [`.status.uncountedTerminatedPods`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98817)

Tracing tally: admission Webhooks' outgoing requests [become traceable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103601), and also [etcd client requests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103216)

## Promotions

* [EndpointSliceProxying to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103451), including the Windows version
* [HugePageStorageMediumSize to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99144), making sizing of Huge Pages configurable
* [EndpointSliceTerminatingCondition to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103596), making `terminating` and `serving` conditions available by default
* [Controller Manager Leader Migration to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103533)

## Deprecated

* [DynamicKubeletConfig is dead](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102966); the feature is being removed instead of promoted due to poor maintenance, support, and adoption.  As of 1.22, it will be deprecated and the feature gate disabled-by-default (it was enabled-by-default in 1.21)
* [Azure and GCP in-tree Auth features are deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102181) thanks to pluggable auth in client-go
* The `--ignore-errors` flag for Node Drain [is deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102677) because it's now the default behavior

## Version Updates

* Metrics Server [Addon Manager to 1.8.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103541)
* [kustomize to v4.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103419) in kubectl
