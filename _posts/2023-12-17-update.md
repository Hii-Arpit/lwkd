## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 2395: Removing In-Tree Cloud Provider Code](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cloud-provider/2395-removing-in-tree-cloud-providers/README.md)

This KEP aims to remove all the cloud provider specific code from the kubernetes/kubernetes repository. This is helpful since it will allow the cloud providers to develop and release their code independent from the Kubernetes release cycle. The KEP goes into the details of how this change is to implemented in four phases. The cloud provider code would first be moved to staging. The controller managers of the respective cloud providers would be built from their own repositories in the second phase. In the third phase, all the cloud provider code would be moved to the respective `k/cloud-provider-<provider>` repository. In the final phase, the support for in-tree cloud providers would be disabled by setting the `DisableCloudProviders` and `DisableKubeletCloudCredentialProvider` flags to true by default.

This KEP graduated to beta in the recent v1.29 release.
