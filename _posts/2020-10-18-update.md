## Developer News

The project is currently debating [moving to 3 releases a year instead of 4](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1290).  Definitely add your
thoughts on the Github Issue if this will affect your development process either way.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Nov 2: Final feature exceptions**

We're currently in Enhancements Freeze, so if you haven't submitted your 1.20 feature
yet, you'll need an [Exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#exceptions) before Nov 2.
Also, placeholder Docs PRs are
due Nov 6, so don't lose track.  There are [55 tracked features](https://bit.ly/k8s-1-20-enhancements)
 filed for 1.20.

Updates [1.19.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md#v1193), [1.18.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v11810), and [1.17.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md#v11713) came out last week.  [As noted](https://lwkd.info/2020/20201013), these had a
lot of fixes in them, so apply soon.  Next patch release phase begins Nov. 6.

## Featured PRs

### [#91014: Move cmd/controller-manager to k8s.io/controller-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91014)

This PR is a big reshuffling of some core code. Most of controller-manager is moved to a new staging package, however some cloud-specific bits are now in `k8s.io/cloud-provider`. This simplifies the overall dependency structure of the KCM and CCM codebases, but do make sure to update any existing PRs to match the new locations.

### [#94489: Do not assume storageclass is still in-tree after csi migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94489)

A subtle bug in the interactions between the PVC controller and out-of-tree CSI plugins was that annotations set for a storage resizer before swapping around CSI plugins would then be out of sync with reality if you tried to resize a volume later. This PR fixes this particular version of the problem but it's a good reminder to always think about invariants in data that will live for a long time and how our code can cope with those invariants breaking.
