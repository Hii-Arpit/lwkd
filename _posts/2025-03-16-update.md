## Developer News

[CVE-2026-1767](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3wgm-2gw2-vh5m) allows authenticated users to [access git repos](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/130786) belonging to other users if created with the in-tree gitRepo volume type.  In-tree gitRepo volumes have been deprecated.  The SRC suggests several workarounds in the [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/130786).

SIG-Windows plans to make the [Windows unit tests](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/FCz-ycGA9D4) release-informing.  This is a big step forwards for support of Kubernetes on Windows.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code and Test Freeze, March 20/21**

Code and Test Freeze starts at 0200 UTC on Friday, March 21.  Your PRs should all be merged by then; file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) as soon as possible if you think you won't make that deadline.
