## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Day, April 17th**

We're closing in on the release of Kubernetes v1.30, which is scheduled for next Wednesday. 

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4008: CRD Validation Ratcheting](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4008-crd-ratcheting)

This KEP proposes to allow custom resources with failing validations to pass if a patch does not alter any of the invalid fields. Currently, validation of unchanged fields stands as a barrier for both CRD authors and Kubernetes developers. This KEP proposes the `CRDValidationRatcheting` feature flag, which when enabled allows updates to custom resources that fail validation to succeed, if the validation errors when on unchanged keypaths. This makes it easier to change CRD validations without breaking existing workflows.

This KEP is tracked to graduate to beta in the upcoming v1.30 release
