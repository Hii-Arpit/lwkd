## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with a demo of [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), a tool from Google's container tools team to allow building container images inside Kubernetes (or other contained environments) without either `privileged` mode (a la `docker-in-docker`) or bind-mounting the underlying control socket from the hypervisor.

This is a big step towards safer image builds from inside Kubernetes-based CI/CD systems, though make sure to read up on the security properties of Kaniko and the other image build options as there are still many "gotchas".

We also heard from the incoming 1.12 release lead, the [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.12/release_team.md) is shaping up nicely. They are still looking for a [branch manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release#release-branch-manager), if you're interested in helping out with either role, message `@tpepper` or the `#sig-release` channel in the [community Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/), or leave a note on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/167). If you're not feeling up to being a role lead, they are also looking for more shadows on CI signal and release notes.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: End of code freeze, June 19th (EOD PST)*

Last week was [week 11](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md) of the 1.11 release cycle.
The biggest milestone last week was documentation complete for 1.11, and things are looking great for an on-time end of code-freeze (19th) and branching for the RC1 release (20th). Big congratulations to Josh and the whole sig-release team for making this one of the smoothest cycles yet!

## Documentation Updates

As this was the week of documentation freeze, we saw lots of great PRs to the docs site land:

* [#8895: Update block device support for 1.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8895)
* [#8900: dns-custom-namerserver: break down the page into mutliple sections](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8900)
* [#8933: Move walkthroughs from user-guide to tutorials](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8933)
* [#8944: replace pearson case study with new one](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8944)
* [#8958: kubeadm-init: update the example for the MasterConfiguration](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8958)
* [#8981: Overall cleanup for kubeadm setup guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8981)
* [#9028: Update kubeadm troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/9028)
* [#9044: Reference doc for kubeadm (release-1.11)](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/9044)
* [#9045: Reference doc for kube-components (release-1.11)](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/9045)

* [#9080: kubectl reference docs for 1.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/9080)

## Merges

Most of the non-documentation PRs merged this week were bug fixes as we are still in code freeze, but a few last-minute updates were landed.

Kubeadm saw a bunch of fixes:

* [#64974: Fix small-ish bugs for v1.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64974)
* [#64988: Set peer urls for default etcd instance](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64988)
* [#65068: Fix kubeadm taints to not override existing node taints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65068)
* [#65104: Makes `kubeletphase.WriteKubeletDynamicEnvFile` run at upgrade time if needed for making v1.10 -> v1.11 upgrades work end to end](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65104)
* [#65151: Fix kubeadm init/upgrade --dry-run mode](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65151)

Vertical Pod Autoscaler was partially merged, but as the bulk of the implementation missed code freeze, it was decided to revert it and pull things back in all together for 1.12:

* [#64890: Revert: Add Vertical Pod Autoscaler to autoscaling/v2beta1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64890)

A reversion from 1.8, when the JSON parsing switched to using `jsoniterator`, it was made case-insensitive. This has now been fixed, but this means any configuration files from 1.8-1.10 that used the incorrect casing will now be invalid:

* [#65034: Make kubernetes json serializer case sensitive](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65034)

## Component Upgrades

* [#65148: Update Cluster Autoscaler to v1.3.0-beta.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65148)
