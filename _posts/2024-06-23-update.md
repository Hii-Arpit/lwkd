## Developer News

Reminder: all jobs on the old test cluster must migrate or die by August 1. [Here's a table](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/docs/job-migration-todo.md) of unmigrated jobs.  While you're at it, start working on [using `--label-filter`](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uBP23XSbypo) to revise how Prow runs your tests.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs Deadline for placeholder PRs, June 27th**

The code freeze deadline [has been extended](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/m_p2IsuDm-Q) from July 10th to July 24th, adding 2 weeks of time in lieu of the US holidays.

## Featured PRs

#125560 [Add field management support to fake client-go typed client](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125560)

This PR introduces a new feature by adding field management support to the fake client-go typed client. This enhancement allows developers to use `fake.NewClientset()` instead of `fake.NewSimpleClientset()` to create a clientset with managed field support. This improvement addresses issue where [Server-Side Apply (and fieldmanagement) was missing in client-go/fake](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/115598) and is crucial for more accurate testing and simulation of Kubernetes API server behaviors in client-go. It ensures that the fake client mimics real client behaviors more closely, benefiting developers who rely on it for unit testing. For more details, refer to [kubernetes/client-go#1184](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/1184) and [#99953](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99953).

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4193: Bound service account token improvements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4193-bound-service-account-token-improvements/)

This (KEP) aims to bind Pod's associated Node information into Kubernetes service account tokens, enhancing their security and traceability. By embedding the Node's name and UID into the JWT tokens and including unique identifiers (JTIs), the KEP ensures robust identity verification and improves auditability. This includes extending the TokenRequest API to bind tokens to Node objects and modifying the TokenReview API to validate these tokens. These changes support mitigating replay attacks and improving the overall security posture of Kubernetes clusters by providing a clear, traceable link between tokens and their originating Node objects.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
