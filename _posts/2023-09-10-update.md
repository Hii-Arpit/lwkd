## Developer News

Please check how the [linter is working](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/myGiml72IbM/m/00vB96RKBAAJ) against your PRs.  Both `pull-kubernetes-linter-hints` and `pull-kubernetes-verify-strict-lint` running on submit.  Right now the latter is non-blocking, but it will change, so please report any times you see it failing to #k8s-code-organization.

Test jobs have been [switched to running only external cloud providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/2681-pod-host-ip), since that's the default.  Check if this breaks your tests.

Contributor Summits:

* [CfP for planned sessions](https://forms.gle/htQSHpot9rp1csDz8) and SIG/team meetings at KCSNA Chicago closes this Friday
* [Registration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcscn/registration/) for KCS Shanghai is open

Also, don't forget to vote for [Steering Committee](https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/steering---2023)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Review Freeze, September 28th**

The [Call for Enhancements](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/MZcoJX6rrm4) is out; time to decide what feature(s) you can realistically finish before Nov. 1.

Patch releases, including a Go version bump, are due out this week.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-2681: Field status.hostIPs added for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/2681-pod-host-ip)

KEP-2681 adds the `status.hostIPs` pod field, which coexists with the singular `status.hostIP` field.  It shows both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for smoother migration during the dual-stack transition phase. This also lets Kubernetes distinguish between the HostIP that is in use (if any), and the list of IPs that are potentially available.

This KEP was created by [Shiming Zhang](https://github.com/wzshiming) and received the `alpha` milestone in `v1.28`.

* [distroless-iptables image to v0.3.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120527)

## Subprojects and Dependency Updates

* [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) [releases v2.23.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/releases/tag/v2.23.0), including several bugfixes and features like supporting Kubernetes 1.27.x versions, adding CPU management policies on the node, and adding ingressClass resource for nginx by default
* [kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery) [v0.14.0 is released](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/releases/tag/v0.14.0). The NodeFeature API is enabled by default. The new CRD based API replaces the previous gRPC based communication, reducing network traffic and allows changes in NodeFeatureRules to take effect immediately. Also, node-feature-discovery now provides Prometheus metrics.
