[KEP-2681: Field status.hostIPs added for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/2681-pod-host-ip)

KEP-2681 introduces the addition of the `status.hostIPs` field for Pods in Kubernetes. 

This enhancement aims to improve the Pod's ability to obtain the address of the node, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for smoother migration during the dual-stack transition phase. 

The proposal outlines the design details and considerations for backward compatibility, along with a clear test plan and graduation criteria. 
While this feature doesn't directly impact running workloads, it enhances Kubernetes' capabilities in managing networking aspects, aligning with evolving IP standards.
