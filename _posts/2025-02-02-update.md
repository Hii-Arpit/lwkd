## Developer News

The [London Maintainer Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/) schedule is up, and registration is open. There will also be an unconference at the event.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, February 6**

Production Readiness Reviews will start this week, and the Enhancements Freeze is next week, so make sure [your 1.33 enhancements are opted in](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/TvHexZLQisg).

Cherry-pick deadline for the February patch release is this Friday.

## Featured PRs

[129816: Improve SA max token expiry with external signer logic, and plumb extended expiry duration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129816)

This PR refines the token expiration handling in the kube-apiserver. It allows you to set the
`--service-account-max-token-expiration` flag when using an external signer—as long as
the specified duration doesn’t exceed the external signer’s maximum—by replacing the
old `IsExternalSigner` check with a dedicated extended signing duration. This change
streamlines the configuration, making token management more straightforward and reliable.

## KEP of the Week

[4815 DRA Partitionable Devices](https://github.com/klueska/k8s-enhancements/blob/53e1584f6d441ff062817503ebee8b80e5e067d6/keps/sig-node/4815-dra-partitionable-devices/README.md)

Support for partitionable devices, such as GPUs, is the next step in the grand implementation plan for dynamic resource allocation (DRA).  Abhishek Malvankar has published [an excellent primer on this KEP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lXGfnrBixRIMW9ESa-mv09Kisb2myVFV_A3nqPJ4FCQ/edit?tab=t.0) which awaits your comments. The goal of this feature is to allow runtime partitioning of GPU resources like microprocessors, graphical engines, and memory between different pods and containers so that workloads can share them as required. The DRA team would like your comments on the proposed API, to make sure that they are covering the capabilities of a variety of popular hardware.
