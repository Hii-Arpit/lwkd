On Thursday the 11th, Jérôme Petazzoni is hosting a special session with the CNCF Maintainers Circle to share his experiences as a container evangelist. Reach out to `#maintainers-circle` on CNCF Slack for more information.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions Deadline, March 1**

The 1.21 Enhancements Freeze is in effect by EOD Feb 9th.  Please check your feature in the [tracking sheet](https://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements); if it's not up to date there you're gonna need an Exception.

The [deadline for cherrypicks](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/-lbzN_JyJ0g) for the next batch of update releases is this Friday.

## Featured PRs

### [#95479: NUMA Memory manager for Kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95479)

If you run large-scale NUMA servers, the Kubelet will now be able to manage NUMA memory affinity. This mirrors the existing CPU manager subsystem, with the only policy defined so far being `--memory-manager-policy=static`. An example of a memory policy:

```
--feature-gates=MemoryManager=true
--kube-reserved=cpu=4,memory=4Gi
--system-reserved=cpu=1,memory=1Gi
--memory-manager-policy=static
--reserved-memory 0:memory=1Gi,hugepages-1M=2Gi
--reserved-memory 1:memory=2Gi
```

If you are using Kubernetes in a NUMA environment, give it a shot and provide feedback to SIG-Node!

### [#95567: test images: Mirrors dockerhub images to staging](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95567)

If you run the end-to-end tests locally and are hitting Docker Hub pull limits, this change should resolve them. This may be useful to locally cherry-pick to older versions if you are still maintaining things.

And to reiterate from the PR, these images are part of the e2e testing system and not for general use.

### [#98678: Graduate TTLAfterFinished to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98678)

After many years as an alpha feature, the TTLAfterFinished system is finally moving up to beta. This feature is enabled through a `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` in both `JobSpec` and `PodSpec`, and if set the controller will automatically delete jobs or pods after they reach a finished state. This functionality has long been relegated to out-of-tree tools but as a common stumbling block, it's great that it will be available to everyone in the next release.
