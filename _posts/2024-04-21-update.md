### [#123905: # Field selector for Services based on ClusterIP and Type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123905)

In clusters with unusually large numbers of headless Services (i.e. Services without a cluster IP), it can cause memory bloat in the Kubelet as it has to cache these as part of the API informer. This PR extends the Service API to allow filtering on both `clusterIP` and `type`, both improving the memory usage of the Kubelet and decreasing load on the API. While this specific optimization only helps a niche audience, it's worth reinforcing how this technique can be applied elsewhere. When optimizing any controller, always keep an eye open for how API watch traffic could be mitigated with server-side logic or filters. Creating field selectors is easy and streamlined, and can likely be used in many more such optimizations.
