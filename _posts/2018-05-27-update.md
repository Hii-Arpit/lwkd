## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with a demo of [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo), a workflow engine implemented as a CRD.  Argo was recently turned into an open community by Intuit, and is compatible with [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow).

SIG Updates:

* Doug Davis reported for [SIG Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-service-catalog).  They recently released the `svcat` command line tool, and are working on moving from a dedicated APIserver to using CRDs.  Other items for a GA release include async bindings, generic brokers, and resolving some issues around namespaces and instance names.  The svcat effort was a mentorship project led by Carol Van Slyck and others.
* Tim Allclair explained what [SIG Auth](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-auth) is working on, including improving the TokenRequest API for 1.11, client-go support for x509 credentials, a scheduling policy design for 1.12, and better metatdata for audit logging.  They have [an open KEP on security conformance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2081).
* [SIG Storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage), per Brad Childs, was fresh back from a face-to-face meeting.  They are moving all storage out of tree to use CSI instead, and will be adding CSI features to 1.11.  Storage has a multi-release plan to expand storage testing, and will be adding more metrics to CSI for SRE monitoring.  They are also reorganizing their 20+ external projects and making sure they all have owners, and will be consolidating the set of storage operators for easy location by users.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: Draft Docs PRs for all features due June 4th*

Last week was [week 8](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md) of the 1.11 release cycle.  Code Slush begins May 29th.  The release is in excellent shape for tests, with only 3 failing tests currently unresolved.  Thank you to all the contributors whose hard work keeps the tests passing.

The Burndown Meetings for Code Slush and Code Freeze will be [at different times](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/148) than in the past.  Please check [the calendar](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-milestone-burndown).

## Feature Work

* CRDs now support [versioning](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63912) for upgrades and install targets.
* [RotateCertificates is now controlled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63912) from the Kubelet Configuration file.
* [Add metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57527) to go with Kubelet dynamic configuration.
* `kubectl auth reconcile` [now has a `--dry-run` flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64458)
* The Openstack provider now [exclusively uses IP addresses](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64318) for node names.
* Azure provider [now logs detailed error messages when it can't find something](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64248).
* APIserver OpenAPI doc now [uses actual document types](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64174).
* [Stop creating reserved blocks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64102) in Ext3/4 volumes.
* `kubectl wait` can now [wait for deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64034) before proceeding.
* [Stop using reapers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63979) to remove objects.
* RBAC auth reconcile now [requires v1 and external types](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63967).
* Azure [supports block devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63841) now.
* Kubelets [can probe](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63328) to discover what plugins they have.
* There's [some basic plumbing](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63232) for topology-aware volumes now.
* CRD printing [can have additional columns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60991).

## Testing Changes

Since we're into Code Slush, SIG Testing has been fixing many tests.

* Several E2E tests are being "upgraded" to Conformance tests, including [pod cgroup test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64472).
* [Fix preemption tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62933).
* [Enable full ENV configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60636) for local testing.

## Now Beta

The following features have been moved to beta for 1.11:

* [Persistent Volume Resizing](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64288).
* [Dynamic Kubelet Config](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64275).

## Kubeadm

Still lots of Kubeadm changes:

* kubeadm now [writes kubelet configs to disk](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63887) for crash recovery, as well as creating matching ConfigMaps.
* [Fix teardown](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63862) when using kubeadm+CRI-O.
* kubeadm `kubedns` subcommand [renamed to `coredns`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64274).
* kubeadm now [downloads containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64105) before starting init.
* `kubeadm config migrate` [command added](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64232), letting you follow API changes automatically.

## Deprecations and Breakage

* kubeadm [won't take the --admission-control argument](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64165) anymore.
* kubectl [now uses apps/v1 for deployments](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61419), which means that 1.11's kubectl will not work with server versions older than 1.9 anymore.
* DeleteOptions.OrphanDependents is [now DeleteOptions.PropagationPolicy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59851).

## Version Updates

* [CoreDNS to 1.1.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64258)

## Other Merges

* json-patch [can stop panicking now](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64355).
* The kubectl wait flag is now [consistent with other flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64375).
* [Check SessionAffinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64180) for the Azure LB.
* [Fix a chronic problem](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64150) with LIST requests from the API.
* [Purge code comments](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64126) of many out-of-date TODO items.
