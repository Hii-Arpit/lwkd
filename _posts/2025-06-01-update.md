[KEP-3331: Structured Authentication Config](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3331-structured-authentication-configuration)

This KEP introduces the capability to add structured authentication configuration to the Kubernetes API server, using a new API Object called `AuthenticationConfiguration`. It supports a JWT token, which serves as the next stage for the OIDC authenticator. Previously, authentication for the API server was performed using command-line flags, which were difficult to manage, validate, and lacked consistency. The KEP implements the Kubernetes API schema for validation and provides a standardized, extensible format, improving configuration clarity.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
