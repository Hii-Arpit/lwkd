## Community Meeting Summary

[Rob Hirschfeld](https://github.com/zehicle) kicked off [the community meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) with a [demo of using Digital Rebar and Kubeadm for zero-touch Kubernetes deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMm6Oz1NF6I).  Announcements included reminders of [Meet Our Contributors this Wednesday](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) and the [Contributor Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/co-located-events/kubernetes-contributor-summit/) in Copenhagen.

The rest of the meeting was devoted to the [1.10 Release Retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZnDqR0rZ4Zj_D9WWdD5JIoF9dZdZRr0giIU0w32bqI).  Release Lead [Jaice DuMars](https://github.com/jdumars) congratulated the release team on getting 1.10 out only a week late despite a security update (with fallout bugs) and major issues with scalability tests. Increased automation, better staffing and better issue tracking were all cited as successes this release.  Areas for improvement included:

* Scalability testing needs to be checked earlier, and more people need to understand the tests.  To help, SIG-Scalability is adding some presubmit tests for scalability.
* Better documentation on what labels are required when and how to approve things for the milestone.
* Running and checking the upgrade/downgrade tests earlier in the development cycle.
* Improving the release notes process to make it less work.
