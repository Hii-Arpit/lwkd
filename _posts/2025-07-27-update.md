## Featured PRs

[133157: KEP 4033: Add metric for out of support CRI and bump feature to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133157)

This PR graduates the `KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI` feature to GA in `v1.34`; It finalizes a multi-release effort that allows the kubelet to retrieve the cgroup driver configuration directly from the container runtime using the CRI API; This improves consistency between kubelet and container runtime settings and removes the need for manual configuration alignment; A new metric has been added to report when the runtime does not support the `Status.cgroupDriver` field in its CRI response, helping identify unsupported or outdated CRI implementations.

[133136: feat: Add warnings for unrecognized formats in CRDs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133136)

This PR updates how Kubernetes handles custom resource definitions (CRDs) that include format values; When a CRD contains a format value that isnâ€™t recognized, the API server now returns a warning during create or update; The CRD is still accepted, but the warning helps you identify issues such as typos or unsupported values.

[133105: KEP-5229: Run Unschedulable scheduler_perf test case with SchedulerAsyncAPICalls feature gate enabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133105)

This PR adds new test configurations that specifically toggle `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` for the `_QueueingHintsEnabled` scenarios within the `Unschedulable` test; These tests measure how the scheduler performs when pods cannot be scheduled, and toggling this feature gate helps validate behavior under different configurations.
