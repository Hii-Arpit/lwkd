## Developer News

Due to low attendance and frequent cancellations, SIG Release is seeking a better meeting time via a [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/group-poll/participate/dPW0QN6b), open until August 3, 2025 (AOE). This applies only to the main SIG Release meeting, not Release Team meetings. Changes will begin the week of August 18, 2025.

A security vulnerability was found in Kubernetes where an unauthorized user may be able to SSH/RDP/WINRM to Windows VMs built with [Kubernetes Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder). Clusters using Image Builder version v0.1.44 or earlier are affected, specifically when using Windows images built with Nutanix OVA. Images from other providers are not affected.

Kubernetes v1.34 has entered Code Freeze as of July 25, 2025. Only release-blocking issues and PRs will be accepted into the v1.34 milestone. Enhancements that didnâ€™t [meet the criteria](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#code-freeze)have been removed, but [exceptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) can be requested if necessary. Key deadlines include July 29 for release highlights and docs PRs, and August 6 for the docs freeze. For concerns, contact the Release Team via email or the #sig-release Slack channel.
