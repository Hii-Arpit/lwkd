## Developer News

Due to low attendance and frequent cancellations, SIG Release is seeking a better meeting time via a [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/group-poll/participate/dPW0QN6b), open until August 3, 2025 (AOE). This applies only to the main SIG Release meeting, not Release Team meetings. Changes will begin the week of August 18, 2025.

A security vulnerability was found in Kubernetes where an unauthorized user may be able to SSH/RDP/WINRM to Windows VMs built with [Kubernetes Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder). Clusters using Image Builder version v0.1.44 or earlier are affected, specifically when using Windows images built with Nutanix OVA. Images from other providers are not affected.

Kubernetes v1.34 has entered Code Freeze as of July 25, 2025. Only release-blocking issues and PRs will be accepted into the v1.34 milestone. Enhancements that didn’t [meet the criteria](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#code-freeze)have been removed, but [exceptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) can be requested if necessary. Key deadlines include July 29 for release highlights and docs PRs, and August 6 for the docs freeze. For concerns, contact the Release Team via email or the #sig-release Slack channel.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs PRs ready for review, July 29**

Code freeze [is in effect](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/c2km3CBdacY) for Kubernetes v1.34. Make sure to get your docs PRs ready for review soon!

## Featured PRs

[133157: KEP 4033: Add metric for out of support CRI and bump feature to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133157)

This PR graduates the `KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI` feature to GA in `v1.34`; It finalizes a multi-release effort that allows the kubelet to retrieve the cgroup driver configuration directly from the container runtime using the CRI API; This improves consistency between kubelet and container runtime settings and removes the need for manual configuration alignment; A new metric has been added to report when the runtime does not support the `Status.cgroupDriver` field in its CRI response, helping identify unsupported or outdated CRI implementations.

[133136: feat: Add warnings for unrecognized formats in CRDs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133136)

This PR updates how Kubernetes handles custom resource definitions (CRDs) that include format values; When a CRD contains a format value that isn’t recognized, the API server now returns a warning during create or update; The CRD is still accepted, but the warning helps you identify issues such as typos or unsupported values.

[133105: KEP-5229: Run Unschedulable scheduler_perf test case with SchedulerAsyncAPICalls feature gate enabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133105)

This PR adds new test configurations that specifically toggle `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` for the `_QueueingHintsEnabled` scenarios within the `Unschedulable` test; These tests measure how the scheduler performs when pods cannot be scheduled, and toggling this feature gate helps validate behavior under different configurations.

## KEP of the Week
[KEP-961: Implement maxUnavailable in StatefulSet](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-apps/961-maxunavailable-for-statefulset/README.md)

This KEP enhances StatefulSet rolling updates by introducing the `maxUnavailable` setting, allowing multiple pods to be updated simultaneously instead of the default one-by-one strategy. It aims to speed up rollouts for large applications while respecting minReadySeconds to maintain availability. The StatefulSet controller is improved to better track pod readiness, and metrics like statefulset_unavailability_violation along with event logs help diagnose rollout issues. 

For the Kubernetes 1.34 release, this KEP is in beta and its inclusion is currently under "Exception Pending" status.
