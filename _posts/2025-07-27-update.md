## KEP of the Week
[KEP-961: Implement maxUnavailable in StatefulSet](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-apps/961-maxunavailable-for-statefulset/README.md)

This KEP enhances StatefulSet rolling updates by introducing the `maxUnavailable` setting, allowing multiple pods to be updated simultaneously instead of the default one-by-one strategy. It aims to speed up rollouts for large applications while respecting minReadySeconds to maintain availability. The StatefulSet controller is improved to better track pod readiness, and metrics like statefulset_unavailability_violation along with event logs help diagnose rollout issues. 

For the Kubernetes 1.34 release, this KEP is in beta and its inclusion is currently under "Exception Pending" status.
