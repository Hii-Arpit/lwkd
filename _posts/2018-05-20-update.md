Prepare yourself for an extra-long LWKD!  Apparently once everyone got home from KubeCon EU, they merged all the code they discussed there, especially the Kubeadm team.  More than 70 changes worth noting, below.

We also have a [new privacy policy](https://lwkd.info/#privacy-notice), in compliance with the GDPR.

## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) featured a demo of [Gardner](https://gardener.cloud/), a new open source multi-cluster manager from the folks at SAP engineering.  This includes a collection of Teraform templates for public clouds called [Kubify](https://github.com/gardener/kubify).

SIG Updates: Bobby Salamat explained [SIG-Scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling)'s current projects, including getting Priority/Preemption to beta, creating an equivalence cache for scheduling, and gang scheduling in order to make scheduling new pods faster.  They're also working on moving taint-based eviction to beta, and designing two new projects: a scheduling framework, and Pod scheduling policy.  For [SIG-Scalabilty](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability), Bob Wise [detailed performance advice and current work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vP3kRPiei5yNrNmsrndWQgZo2idcc8uN0LgjK4xt2wU/edit), including that users should use tested etcd versions and test clusters with Kubemark.  They're working on better real-workload testing, and having a presubmit mini-performance test.  Daniel Smith of [SIG-API Machinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery) introduced their "new dynamic client" with a better interface.  The old client is now deprecated.  CRDs will be versioned in 1.11, and they will also be launching an "Apply Working Group" which will govern a feature branch to change how Apply is implemented.

As always, Kubernetes is [looking for mentors](https://goo.gl/forms/17Fzwdm5V2TVWiwy2).  The next [Meet our Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/e83e81615387f616d5aa51f18bc4310279a0a383/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) is June 6th.  The [Discourse Forum](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/) for Kubernetes is now active, and the community will be running a 3-hour AMA at DockerCon on June 13th.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: May 25th, placeholder Doc PRs are due for all new features.*

1.11.0 beta0 was released on May 16th.

Due to the hard work of many contributors in diagnosing and fixing test failures, CI signal is relatively clean and the Release Team is [delaying and shortening Code Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md#conditionally-shortening-code-freeze) as promised.  Code Slush now begins a week later, on May 29th and Code Freeze on June 5th.

## Feature Work

* Dynamic Kubelet config now [supports changes to the ConfigMap](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63221).
* Kubelet config validation [now understands feature gates](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63409), and [reports its status as machine-readable JSON](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63314) instead of human-oriented text.
* kube-up.sh [uses crictl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63357) on GCE.
* Auditing now [truncates too-large event messages](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64024).
* The GRPC client in the kubelet [increased response size to 8MB](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63977).
* You can [pass optional args to etcd](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63961) on GCE now.
* vSphere can [store cloud credentials in Kube secrets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63902), and [supports SAML](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63824).
* The kubernetes-worker charm [supports NFS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63817).
* `Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses` [added to the API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63742), as planned in 1.9 (oops).
* The APIServer [now watches](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63469) for new secrets coming from nodes.
* Kubectl [speaks Korean](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62040).
* Services can [listen on the same port on different interfaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62003).
* Kubectl will soon [error on duplicate names](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60464) in its config.

## Now Beta

Lots of things are getting promoted to Beta in 1.11!

* CRD Subresources are [beta and enabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63598).
* CRI Log Rotation is [beta and on by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64046) (and the log is [in a new location](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62015)).
* The priorityClass API [is now beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63100).

## Kubeadm Changes

This was a super-busy week for the Kubeadm team.

* Now defaults to [using CoreDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63509).
* Upgrades [work with external etcd clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63925), as does [CAcert configration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63806).
* Kubeadm can [pull images](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63833) using crictl.
* Kubeadm has [a command to print the default config](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63969), and another to [see planned upgrade steps](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63930).
* Kubeadm will [soon stop supporting Kubernetes before 1.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63920).

## Deprecated

* The public cadvisor port is [gone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63881), as promised last release cycle.
* UID mutation has been [removed from request.context](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59775).
* Unused fields left over from Kubeadm etcd self-hosting attempt [have been removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63871).
* Kubelets/nodes can [no longer modify their own taints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63167).
* InfluxDB monitoring support [will be dropped from 1.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62328).
* Dial has been [replaced by DialContext](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60012) in client-go.

## Version Updates

* Stackdriver [event-exporter to 0.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63918).

## Other Merges

* [Close connections if the Kubelet can't connect to the API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63492) instead of hanging waiting for cert validation. Might get backported.
* Openstack Node names have been [reverted to their pre-1.10 conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63903), to stop breaking existing deployments.
* `kubectl describe sts` [includes update strategy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63844).

* The Scheduler unit tests [support subtests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63658).
