### [KEP 1790: Recovery from volume expansion failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/1790-recover-resize-failure/README.md)

This KEP proposes allowing users to reduce a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) size after a failed expansion due to storage provider limitations. To prevent quota abuse, a new field, `pvc.Status.AllocatedResources`, ensures accurate tracking. Users can retry expansion with a smaller size, and quota calculations will use the maximum of `pvc.Spec.Capacity` and `pvc.Status.AllocatedResources`.

This KEP is tracked for beta in the ongoing release cycle.
