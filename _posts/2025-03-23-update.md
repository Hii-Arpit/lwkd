## Developer News

Multiple issues have been discovered in ingress-nginx that can result in arbitrary code execution. This can lead to disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. The most serious of these issues have been rated CRITICAL. Take a look at the official announcement [here](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/w00V5hQpX7I).

There will not be an LWKD issue next week because of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU. Happy KubeCon week to everyone attending!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs PRs ready for review, March 25**

Code freeze [is in effect](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/kBCwuTAhOvI) for Kubernetes v1.33. Folks who have got their KEPs tracked for the release, make sure to get your docs PRs ready for review soon!

## Featured PRs

### [Container Stop Signals](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130556)

This PR adds the initial implementation for the alpha release of custom container stop signals. A new container Lifecycle, StopSignal has been added with which users are able to define custom stop signals for their containers, overriding the default signal set in the image/container runtime. This PR adds StopSignal to container Lifecycle and also adds a StopSignal field to both ContainerConfig and ContainerStatus in the CRI API. Once the logic for using the custom stop signal has been added to the different container runtimes, the runtimes would also report the effective stop signal used by containers in their respective container statuses.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 1790: Recovery from volume expansion failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/1790-recover-resize-failure/README.md)

This KEP proposes allowing users to reduce a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) size after a failed expansion due to storage provider limitations. To prevent quota abuse, a new field, `pvc.Status.AllocatedResources`, ensures accurate tracking. Users can retry expansion with a smaller size, and quota calculations will use the maximum of `pvc.Spec.Capacity` and `pvc.Status.AllocatedResources`.

This KEP is tracked for beta in the ongoing release cycle.
