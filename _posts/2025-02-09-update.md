## Featured PRs

### [#129731: SidecarContainers to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129731)

Sidecar containers feature is finally promoted to GA in v1.33. The `SidecarContainers` feature gate has been locked to default value and will be removed in v1.36. The [original KEP for sidecar containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753) was first introduced in v1.28. The KEP proposed built-in support for sidecar containers in Kubernetes with the sidecar containers running as restartable initContainers.

### [#128367 FG:InPlacePodVerticalScaling Implement resize for sidecar containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128367)

This PR implements resize for sidecar contianers, with sidecar containers now promoted to GA. Resize of sidecar containers now works the same as resize of regular containers. This PR adds the capability to resize sidecar containers, which are essentially restartable init containers, when in-place pod resizing is enabled. Resize of non-restartable init containers is still not allowed.
