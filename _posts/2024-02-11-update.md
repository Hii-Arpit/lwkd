## Developer News

The Contributor Summit is [looking for volunteers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexzKa8f-0d-AvlutGmDPwTImtlJBIndTYE5n4pEw5UqJU4SA/viewform) and a [few more pre-planned sessions](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/lwXnyP0ItY0); remember that KCS sessions need to target contributors.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs Deadline for placeholder PRs, February 22nd**

We are [in Enhancements Freeze now](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/50QpY6-S5-A), and currently have 84 opted-in, 56 tracked, and 28 removed features.  If your feature missed the deadline, you need to [file an Exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

Patch releases, including a Go update, are due out this week for Valentine's Day!  This is likely to be the last patch release for Kubernetes 1.26. Tell your partner you love them by updating all their clusters.

Roses are red
Violets are blue
Golang's outdated
1.26 is EOL too
