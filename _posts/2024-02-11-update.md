## Developer News

The Contributor Summit is [looking for volunteers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexzKa8f-0d-AvlutGmDPwTImtlJBIndTYE5n4pEw5UqJU4SA/viewform) and a [few more pre-planned sessions](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/lwXnyP0ItY0); remember that KCS sessions need to target contributors.

Need a technical summer intern? We can still accept project proposals for the [CNCF Google Summer of Code application](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/programs/summerofcode/2024.md) if you get them in soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs Deadline for placeholder PRs, February 22nd**

We are [in Enhancements Freeze now](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/50QpY6-S5-A), and currently have 84 opted-in, 56 tracked, and 28 removed features.  If your feature missed the deadline, you need to [file an Exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

Patch releases, including a Go update, are due out this week for Valentine's Day!  This is likely to be the last patch release for Kubernetes 1.26. Tell your partner you love them by updating all their clusters.

Roses are red
Violets are blue
Golang's outdated
1.26 is EOL too

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-3962: Mutating Admission Policies](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/3962-mutating-admission-policies)

This KEP introduces mutating admission policies, declared using CEL expressions, improving on mutating admission webhooks. It leverages the power of CEL object construction and Server Side Apply's merge algorithms to allow in-process mutations.

Mutations are specified within a `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` resource, referencing parameter resources for configuration. `Reinvocation` will support it as well. Metrics and safety checks are being developed to ensure idempotence and deterministic final states. While limitations exist (e.g., no deletion), this feature offers a declarative and efficient way to perform common mutations, reducing complexity and improving performance.

This KEP was created in 2023, and is planned to reach its alpha milestone in v1.30 release.
