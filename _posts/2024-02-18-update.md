## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exception Requests Due, February 26th**

We are in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/50QpY6-S5-A) with 85 Enhancements on the [tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/175). Any KEPs that wish to join the v1.30 release must now have an approved Exception.

## KEP of the Week

[4402: go workspaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/4402-go-workspaces)

SIG-Arch is adding go workspace support to Kubernetes to simplfy our build tools adn remove code.  However, all code generation tools based on gengo will break, and the CLI for kube_codegen will change.  If you use any of our code generation tools, you will have work to do after [the PR merges](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122624), probably for 1.31.

## Other Merges
