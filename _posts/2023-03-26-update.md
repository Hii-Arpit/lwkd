## Developer News

The EU Contributor Summit [call for session proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z7TnjixN9fiuQulF-EU9rw7_U9I-I8HNOv28IAFsHZc/viewform) ends this Friday; if you want to do something at the KCSEU, please fill it out.  Note that this includes SIG Meetings, so if your SIG would like a room, use the form.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Everything Is Due, April 4th**

Everything is frozen, everything is due on 4/4, including final edited docs, themes, and feature blogs.  It's time to put 1.27 to bed for hopefully an on-time release April 11th.  1.27rc0 was [released last week](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/laH9_UoOl7g), so for all the folks who aren't SIG Chairs or docs people, it's time for you to test the new version with your stacks and tools, and report bugs ASAP.

Let's get 1.27 out on time!

* [`kubernetes/grpc` is not a standard appProtocol](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116866) and never was, so remove
