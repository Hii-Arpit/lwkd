## Developer News

The Contributor Summit Detroit (at KubeCon North America 2022) has [opened the call for sessions](https://www.k8s.dev/events/2022/kcsna/cfp/).  If you have a discussion topic, workshop, SIG meeting, or anything else by and for contributors, suggest it by September 30.  Also, [register now](https://www.k8s.dev/events/2022/kcsna/registration/) so we have a better headcount for allocating space.

[Steering committee ballots](https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/steering---2022) are due by September 29th. Vote now! If you're still not on the voter rolls and think you should be (if you're reading this, you likely qualify) make sure you get your exception request in by September 16th.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze for Enhancements, September 29th**

[Enhancements for 1.26](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/lnxXgZmOOMo) are due by October 6th, but you should get them opted-in by 9/29 so that the PRR has time to review them.

Patch releases are expected out Wednesday.

## Featured PR

### [#111122: support removal of event handlers from SharedIndexInformers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111122)

As operators have gotten more complex, there has been a growth in the use cases for "dynamic listeners", controllers which can listen to any object type and are configured at runtime. While controllers using the SharedInformer cache pattern have been able to add new listeners on the fly, they haven't previously been able to shut down and remove listeners that are no longer needed. This has lead to slow bloat issues in some cases, requiring periodic restarts to get back to a minimal state. With this PR, `AddEventHandler` and friends now return an opaque handle which can be passed to a new `RemoveEventHandler` to do exactly what it says in the name. This unlocks many more efficient operator architectures for complex scenarios.
