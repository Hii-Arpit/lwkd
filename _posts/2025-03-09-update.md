## Developer News

The next [New Contributor Orientation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/mentoring/new-contributor-orientation#readme) will be March 18. Scripts for the NCO are complete, so if you'd be willing to run one someday, please contact SIG-ContribEx.

SIG/WG Leads, please finish your [2024 annual reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20annual%20report) if you have not already.

KubeCon London Reminders: [Meet & Greet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/8353) and [register](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/#registration) for the Maintainer Summit

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, March 20**

Exceptions are closed, and we are on the countdown to Code Freeze, plus [many other deadlines](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Y0tzxSb_XVg).

Patch releases [1.29.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md), [1.30.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), [1.31.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md), and [1.32.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md) are available.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4960: Container Stop Signals](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4960-container-stop-signals/README.md)

This KEP aims to add the container runtime level STOPSIGNAL instruction to the Kubernetes API. The KEP proposes adding a StopSignal container lifecycle which takes a valid signal which would be sent to the container runtime when the container is stopped. Currently the only way to configure custom stop signals is to bake them in the container image definition. This is difficult if you are using third party images. Container runtimes today reads the stop signal defined in container images and if there is none defined, falls back to SIGTERM. The new StopSignal lifecycle would have a higher priority than both of these. If a container has a stop signal defined in the container spec, that signal would be used over the signal defined in the image. The stop signal would get the default value of SIGTERM if no signal is defined in either the container spec or in the image definition. 

This KEP is tracked for alpha in the ongoing 1.33 release cycle.
