## Developer News

VM images built with [Kubernetes Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) older than v0.1.37 have [a security hole](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128007) that may allow remote login.  This includes Proxmox, Nutanix, OVA, QEMU, and raw providers.  Upgrade to v0.1.38 or later, and rebuild your VM images.

SIG-Release is [planning to phase out artifacts for some architectures](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/12uRwQIi51U) by 1.33.  In 1.32, the updated cross-build images for ppc64le and s390x will not be released, because of broken dependencies.
