## Developer News

VM images built with [Kubernetes Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) older than v0.1.37 have [a security hole](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128007) that may allow remote login.  This includes Proxmox, Nutanix, OVA, QEMU, and raw providers.  Upgrade to v0.1.38 or later, and rebuild your VM images.

SIG-Release is [planning to phase out artifacts for some architectures](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/12uRwQIi51U) by 1.33.  In 1.32, the updated cross-build images for ppc64le and s390x will not be released, because of broken dependencies.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs placeholder PRs deadline, October 24**

The enhancements freeze was last week and we have a total of 60 KEPs tracked for v1.32. 9 enhancements did not making the cut for the enhancements freeze and 9 were deferred. Coming up next is the deadline for getting your docs placeholder PRs open, on 24th of October. If your KEP is tracked for v1.32 and if you have updates to the docs, don't forget to open your PRs in time!

The patch releases planned for October [have been moved](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ycnFVQwOlz8) to Tuesday, October 22, 2024.

## Featured PRs

### [#127878 [scheduler] calculate pod requests resources with sidecar containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127878)

This PR updates the scheduler scoring process to consider the resource requests of existing sidecar containers when scheduling Pods. As per the [sidecar containers KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/753-sidecar-containers/README.md#resources-calculation-for-scheduling-and-pod-admission), resources calculations for scheduling pods with sidecars is supposed to be: `Max(Max( each InitContainerUse ), Sum(Sidecar Containers) + Sum(Containers))`, but existing scheduler logic was using `Max(RegularContainers, InitContainers)` to calculate resources instead.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3104: Introduce kuberc](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/3104-introduce-kuberc/README.md)

This KEP proposes to introduce a new kuberc file that can be used to separate cluster credentials and server configuration from user preferences. This new and entirely opt-in kuberc file would allow users to configure aliases and default flags and also aims to deprecate the [kubeconfig Preferences field](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4b024fc4eeb4a3eeb831e7fddec52b83d0b072df/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api/v1/types.go#L40). While in alpha, this feature can be enabled by setting the KUBECTL_KUBERC environment variable to true. The file will default to being located in ~/.kube/kuberc. A flag will allow overriding this default location with a path i.e. kubectl --kuberc /var/kube/rc.

This KEP is tracked for alpha release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
