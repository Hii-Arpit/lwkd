## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4568: Resilient watchcache initialization](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4568-resilient-watchcache-initialization/README.md)

This KEP proposes to mitigate the issues that can lead to an overload of the of kube-apiserver and etcd during its initialization or reinitialization of the watchcache layer.

The first step is to reduce the number of requests during initialization by introducing a new PostStartHook that will wait for watchcache of all builtin resources to be initialized. It will also introduce the rejection of hanging watches with Too Many Requests 429 http code. 
There will also be an adjustment to what lists are being delegated to etcd.

This KEP is tracked to be promoted to beta in the upcoming 1.31 release.
