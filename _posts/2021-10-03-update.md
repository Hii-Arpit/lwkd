## Release Schedule

Folks are hard at work on their features.  Expect little release news until after KubeCon.

Next update cherry-picks due October 15th.

## Other Merges

* CustomResourceValidationExpressions [has a feature gate now](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105107) and is well on its way to being a 1.23 feature
* Building official binaries in PIE (position independent executable) mode [has been reverted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105352) because of a major performance regression
* Add [TransformingInformers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104300) for API calls
* All executables [pay attention to `--log-flush-frequency`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105076)
* Run kubectl on [Windows on ARM](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104894)
* Topology Hints [ignore control plane nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104744)
* Make sure to [check generic ephemeral volumes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100482) in all the places, and make sure that [they work correctly in the PodSpec](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105293)
* As a first contribution, Shuhei Kitagawa [added tests for Kubelet API defaults](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105116); welcome!

## Deprecated

* All klog flags other than `-v` and `-vmodule` [are now deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105042), because the klog flags are a bit of [messy Kubernetes history](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/2845-deprecate-klog-specific-flags-in-k8s-components/README.md#motivation) and very hard to maintain

## Removals

* v1beta1 API for scheduler component config file [is removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104782); use the v1beta3 API now
