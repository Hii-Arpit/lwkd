## Developer News

The [Kubernetes Annual Report Summary](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/06/01/annual-report-summary-2021/) is now live, check it out.

The Kubernetes project is [attempting to spread its container image traffic across several registries](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/wiki/New-Registry-url-for-Kubernetes-(registry.k8s.io)).  As such, Arnaud would like you to [direct traffic](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/DYZYNQ_A6_c) to the new registry pool at `registry.k8s.io`.

Tim Hockin is [looking for help](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/zcGFMru0gPU) to convert Kubernetes to use Go Workspaces instead of the older Modules; join the [code reorganization subproject](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/9fb7dda78a0cffac8051e98caca6e75f9893ff11/sig-architecture/README.md#code-organization) to pitch in.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze June 17th**

We are well into the "KEP writing" phase of 1.25.  You need your KEPs done and listed with the Enhancements team by June 17th/18th to have your feature included.  Please also give the Production Readiness Review team a draft version of the KEP a week before that (June 9th) so they can organize their reviews.

Cherrypick deadline for patch releases is this Friday, June 10th, for a release on June 15th.  This will be the *last* patch for 1.21, so get in any criticals, and prepare to upgrade.
