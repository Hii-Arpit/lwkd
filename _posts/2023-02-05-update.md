## Developer News

The old image registry, k8s.gcr.io, will [stop taking updates](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/kgWu5q6h8fs) on April 3.  As a contributor, you need to [make sure that you're pushing builds](https://cs.k8s.io/?q=k8s.gcr.io&i=nope&files=%2F*.yaml%7C%2F*.sh&excludeFiles=&repos=) to registry.k8s.io and that any components that you call are pulling from the new registry. Users should also check any of their CI that pulls images.

The Kubernetes Java client [is affected by CVE-2022-1471](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/2532), a remote code execution.  Update your Java client ASAP.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Thursday Feb. 9th**

We're in PRR soft freeze, so if your KEP is not yet ready for review, you're [at the end of the queue](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/PMyXzl58fh8).  You only have a couple days before [Enhancements Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) anyway, so get those KEPs in reviewable shape and opt in.

Cherry-picks for the next set of [patch releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) are due Friday the 10th.

## Featured PR

### [#115377: Fetch go version using gimme if needed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115377)

Environment setup is always a complicated topic. This PR automates installing the correct version of Go using Travis' `gimme` tool. They will get unpacked into `.gimme` in your build output folder, so this should be safe and do the correct thing in almost all situations. However if you want to make sure your system-level Go environment is used, `export FORCE_HOST_GO=y`. You may also want to check on your CI configuration, on one hand this will simplify CI setups but it will also potentially increase build times.
