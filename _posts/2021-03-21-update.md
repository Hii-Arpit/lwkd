## Developer News

It's now spring/fall, and we are in Code Freeze.

Han Kang and folks are [spinning up a new Structured Logging Migration WG](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/y4WIw-ntUR8) to complete the changeover. Tim Allclair is [stepping down as SIG-Auth lead](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/oTbNAmBL86o) and nominating Rita Zhang as chair.

The Monthly Community Meeting is [changing formats](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/_D1-zDfucfY) to make it more useful for contributors, so bring your contentious development discussions with you.  Meet Our Contributors is also [coming back](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/2f_DHXwnzgc) and is looking for hosts.

## Release Schedule
