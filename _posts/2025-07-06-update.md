## Developer News

The Kubernetes SIG-Architecture group, a proposal has been made to form a new Working Group focused on [AI Conformance Certification](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance). This group aims to define a standardized set of capabilities, APIs, and configurations that Kubernetes clusters must support to reliably and efficiently run AI/ML workloads.

Kubernetes has formed a dedicated [Checkpoint/Restore Working Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5091) to integrate native Checkpoint/Restore functionality, enabling container migration and workload pre-emption to improve resource efficiency and support advanced use cases like AI/ML.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code and Test Freeze, July 24/25**

Code and Test Freeze starts at 0200 UTC on Friday, July 25. Your PRs should all be merged by then.

Cherry-picks for the July Patch Releases are due on July 11.

## Featured PRs

[131641: DRA kubelet: add dra_resource_claims_in_use gauge vector](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131641)

This PR introduces a new gauge vector metric, `dra_resource_claims_in_use`, to the Kubelet; This metric tracks active DRA drivers and informs administrators when a driver is in use, ensuring safe removal of drivers without impacting pod operations; This metric is useful to determine if drivers have active ResourceClaims, preventing issues during the driver removal process.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-2831: Kubelet Tracing](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/2831-kubelet-tracing/README.md)

This KEP adds support for distributed tracing in the kubelet to help diagnose node-level issues like pod creation latency or container startup delays.
It solves the problem of limited visibility into how the kubelet talks to the API server and container runtime by exporting trace data. The implementation uses `OpenTelemetry` to generate and export spans in the OTLP format. An `OpenTelemetry Collector`, typically deployed as a `DaemonSet`, receives and forwards this data to a tracing backend.The feature is enabled through the `KubeletTracing` feature gate and configured using the TracingConfiguration in the kubelet configuration file.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
