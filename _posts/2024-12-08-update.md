## Release Schedule

It's 1.32 Release Week!  Just to make sure you noticed the release team [put out an extra Release Candidate](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/mfC1ZxYbs6E) (also to fix [two release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128986) [blocking issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/129080)).  With that, here's a little taste of the new/alpha features in 1.32 according to the [Enhancements Board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/195/views/1):

* [Mutating Admission Policies](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962) based on CEL
* Allow [splitting stdout and stderr](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3288) in container log stream
* Resource limits [at the pod level](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837)
* The Topology scheduler [knows about shared L3 caches](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4800)
* [Statusz page](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4827) and [Flagz page](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4828) for all core components
* Fine-grained [Node API authorizations](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2862)
* Supporting [external signers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/740) for service account tokens
* Windows gets [CPU and Memory affinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4885)
* [CBOR data format](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4222) as a JSON alternative

Of course, there are tons more enhancements, and 30 features are graduating to Beta or Stable.  Find out more, and download and try, when Kubernetes 1.32 comes out tommorrow.

In the meantime, we have a bunch of patch releases; [1.29.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md), [1.30.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), [1.31.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md) are now available, mainly containing a golang update.
