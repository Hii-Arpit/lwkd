## Developer News

[CVE-2024-3177](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/TjHVWbZu9Cs), rated Low, was discovered in Kubernetes, where users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Day, April 17th**

[Kubernetes v1.30.0-rc.2 is live!](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/PDfskMmnwpw)

Kubernetes v1.30 is scheduled to be released today. To accommodate this, patch releases [v1.27.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.27.13), [v1.28.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.28.9) and [v1.29.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.29.4) have been [cut one day early](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/TCroZRkWjco).

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3141:Prevent unauthorised volume mode conversion during volume restore](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3141-prevent-volume-mode-conversion)

The KEP proposes preventing unauthorized volume mode conversion when creating PVCs from `VolumeSnapshots` in Kubernetes. It introduces modifications to the `VolumeSnapshotContent` API spec, control flows of snapshot-controller and external-provisioner, and an annotation name `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/allow-volume-mode-change` on `VolumeSnapshotContent` resources. These changes mitigate security vulnerabilities while allowing authorized use cases, such as backup processes, to proceed efficiently. This addresses potential exploitation by malicious users and aims to prevent kernel vulnerability, particularly in scenarios involving potential future CVEs affecting filesystems.

This KEP is tracked to graduate to stable in the upcoming v1.30 release.
