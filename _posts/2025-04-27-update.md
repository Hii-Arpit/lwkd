## Developer News

In Kubernetes 1.33, improvements were made to the [E2E tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130908). In short, if your test depends on feature gates and not the actual E2E "features", the CI system can now automatically run them by default in shared alpha/beta feature test jobs without any action on your part. The team is looking to improve the [E2E testing process for 1.34](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131040).
