## Developer News

In Kubernetes 1.33, improvements were made to the [E2E tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130908). In short, if your test depends on feature gates and not the actual E2E "features", the CI system can now automatically run them by default in shared alpha/beta feature test jobs without any action on your part.
