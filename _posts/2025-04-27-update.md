## Developer News

[Benjamin Elder reminded contributors](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uVga86nJDuI)
of the changes to the [E2E Testing Framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130908) that take effect now.  Contributors must use `framework.WithFeatureGate(features.YourFeature)` for tests related to specific feature gates to ensure proper execution in CI jobs. Tests need to specify both feature gates and cluster configurations.


After 5 long years, SIG-Testing has finally acheived [zero hard-coded test skips](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/34731) in `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` and related jobs. This is near parity with `pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce` (1056 tests vs 1080 test) in approximately half the runtime (~30m vs ~1h).

The CFPs for the [Project Lighting talks, Maintainer's Track and ContribFest at KubeCon NA 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/project-opportunities/) are now live! Get your submissions in before 7th July.

Please read and comment on an ongoing discussion about AI-generated contributions to [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/291). Several repositories have been receiving AI-generated submissions which look acceptable until carefully reviewed. Younger developers may be more reliant on AI and may not realize that such contributions are unacceptable. Community members are discussing whether we need a more restrictive policy than [the Linux Foundation's](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai).
