## Developer News

In Kubernetes 1.33, improvements were made to the [E2E Testing Framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130908). The update required contributors to use `framework.WithFeatureGate(features.YourFeature)` for tests related to specific feature gates to ensure proper execution in CI jobs. For more inforamtion on the changes, please refer to the [Google Group Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uVga86nJDuI). The tests need to specify both the feature gates as well as cluster configurations. . The team is looking to improve the [E2E testing process for 1.34](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131040).


After 5 long years, the team has finally acheived [zero hard-coded test skips](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/34731) in `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` and related jobs. This is near parity with `pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce` (1056 tests vs 1080 test) in approximately half the runtime (~30m vs ~1h).

The CFPs for the [Maintainer's Summit at KubeCon NA 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/project-opportunities/) are now live! Get your talks in before 7th July.

There's an ongoing discussion about the use of AI within the [Kubernetes GitHub Org](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/291). The short version of the discsussion is that a lot of the repositories have been receving spammy AI content which looks fine from a high level, but at closer look there are a lot of issues with it. And the newer generation is more reliant on AI and may not see anything wrong. The discussion is about setting up a guidance policy around AI use in the CNCF, similar to the [Policy that exists for LFX](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai).
