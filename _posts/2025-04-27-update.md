## Developer News

[Benjamin Elder reminded contributors](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uVga86nJDuI) of the changes to the [E2E Testing Framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130908) that take effect now.  Contributors must use `framework.WithFeatureGate(features.YourFeature)` for tests related to specific feature gates to ensure proper execution in CI jobs. Tests need to specify both feature gates and cluster configurations.

After 5 long years, SIG-Testing has finally acheived [zero hard-coded test skips](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/34731) in `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` and related jobs. This is near parity with `pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce` (1056 tests vs 1080 test) in approximately half the runtime (~30m vs ~1h).

Applications for [Project Lighting talks, Maintainer's Track and ContribFest at KubeCon NA 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/project-opportunities/) are open! Get your submissions in before 7th July.

Please read and comment on an ongoing discussion about AI-generated contributions to [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/291). Several repositories have been receiving AI-generated submissions which look acceptable until carefully reviewed. Younger developers may be more reliant on AI and may not realize that such contributions are unacceptable. Community members are discussing whether we need a more restrictive policy than [the Linux Foundation's](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.34 Release Cycle Begins -- soon**

We are in the between-release limbo period, so time to work on whatever you want.  That irritating bug, the subproject you've been meaning to investigate, a birdhouse, whatever.  The call for enhancements will come soon enough.

## Featured PRs

[131491: kubectl describe service: Add Traffic Distribution](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131491)

This PR shows the [Traffic Distribution field](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#traffic-distribution), added in Kubernetes 1.31, in `kubectl describe service` if the field is set. This makes the field much more accessible and useful to users.

[130782: Kubeadm issue #3152 ControlPlane node setup failing with "etcdserver: can only promote a learner member"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130782)

This PR fixes a bug where in `kubeadm` ControlPlane node setup fails with the error "etcdserver: can only promote a learner member"; This PR adds a check to ensure that promotion does not retry if the member is already promoted and introduces a call to remove the learner member if the promotion fails entirely.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 1769: Speed up recursive SELinux label change](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1710-selinux-relabeling)

This KEP speeds up volume mounts on SELinux-enforcing systems by using the `-o context=XYZ` mount option instead of slow recursive relabeling. It has rolled out in three phases: starting with `ReadWriteOncePod` volumes (v1.28), then adding metrics and an opt-out (v1.32), and finally applying to all volumes by default in 1.33.
