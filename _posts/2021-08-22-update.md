## Developer News

Vallery Lancey and Nabarun Pal have been elected to the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://git.k8s.io/community/committee-code-of-conduct) for the 2021-2023 term.

SIG-Docs is [looking for contributors](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/zA3q5MaIzp0), particularly folks interested in becoming reviewers, and eventually Chairs. If you like writing, SIG-Docs is the place for you!

Is Code Freeze too long?  Too short?  Just right?  [Add your thinky bits to the discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1674).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Sept. 9**

The 1.23 release cycle [began today](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/r2C1a86tuI0).  As always, [the call for Enhancements](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/SY4E4q-r_CA) is the first activity we'll see, and notably the [PRR Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md) would like to see the PRR part of your KEP a week before, on Sept. 2nd, if at all possible.

[1.22.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), with the first batch of post-release fixes, is now available.

## Featured PRs

### [#104368: golang 1.17 fails to parse IPs with leading zeros](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104368)

One of the backwards-incompatible changes in Go 1.17 is that `net.ParseIP` and `net.ParseCIDR` now reject IPs with leading zeroes, such as `1.2.3.004`. In Go 1.16 these would parse but octets with a leading zero would be interpreted as octal, leading to both user confusion and potential security issues in edge cases. This unfortunately puts us in a difficult place as we can't (or at least really prefer not to) change the validation behavior in ways that affect existing stored data. As a temporary "no worse than it was before" solution we have added two functions to `k8s.io/utils/net`, `ParseIPSloppy` and `ParseCIDRSloppy`. If you are interacting with stored IPs or CIDR masks in Kubernetes types, please make sure you use these going forward rather than the `net` versions. And stay tuned for future updates as this is hopefully only a stopgap answer.

### [#101081: kubelet: add graceful shutdown events](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101081)

The graceful node shutdown allows giving pods time to be evicted before a node terminates or reboots. As a new addition, this will also yield a `Shutdown` type event into the Node object's event stream. This can be used for fleet analysis, scripting waits, or alerting.

### [#104281: send retry-after until the apiserver is ready](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104281)

And finally a short but useful feature, a `--startup-send-retry-after-until-ready=true` command line option for kube-apiserver to set it to return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests and a `Retry-After` header in the (short) time between the listening socket being opened and the API server being ready for requests. If you work on a Kubernetes client that doesn't already support 429/Retry-After, now would be a great time to add it!

## Other Merges

* Prevent [an LRU cache panic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104466) in most of the Kubernetes processes; backported to 1.22, where the issue first appears
* Kubectl stops [recommending flags that don't exist](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103852)
* Metrics: `apiserver_longrunning_requests` [is the new](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103799) `apiserver_longrunning_gauge`, and [rationalize the Volume Scheduling duration metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100720)
* Append [the server context path](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97350) to `kubectl proxy` requests, so they don't have to be in the URL

## Version Updates

* [Node Feature Discovery 0.9.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/releases/tag/v0.9.0) is out
* [cri-tools to 1.22.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104430)
