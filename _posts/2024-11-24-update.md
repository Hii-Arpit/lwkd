## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Highlights completion, December 3rd**

Docs freeze is in effect as of Tuesday 26th November. We are now in the final phases of the v1.32 release cycle with the scheduled release date  just two weeks away.

Kubernetes [v1.32.0-rc.0 is live!](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/mBnmSYH0B_g). v1.32.0-rc.1 is scheduled to be cut on Monday, December 3rd.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-3157: Allow informers for getting a stream of data instead of chunking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/3157-watch-list/README.md)

This KEP addresses the kube-apiserver's vulnerability to excessive memory consumption caused by `LIST` requests in large clusters, which can lead to server crashes, node pressure, and workload disruption. To solve this, it proposes reducing temporary memory usage from an exponential scale to a manageable constant, leveraging the watch cache to reduce etcd load, ensuring consistent and fresh `LIST` responses, and maintaining backward compatibilityâ€”all while protecting the server and its node from `OOM scenarios`

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
