## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-4802: Graceful Node Shutdown for Windows Node](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4802)

This KEP extends node graceful shutdown to Windows, enabling Kubelet to handle shutdowns by triggering proper pod termination, including pre-stop hooks. It focuses on nodes where Kubelet runs as a Windows service, ensuring a cloud-agnostic approach with minimal shutdown delays and adherence to the expected pod lifecycle.

This KEP is tracked for alpha release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
