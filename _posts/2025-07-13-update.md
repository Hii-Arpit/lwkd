## Developer News

SIG-Network proposed a new [AI Gateway Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WTdHYW5x2rw6BTgDzW7X-5QNesAh205MuoaUe5-IQg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3pja9jwpcsxf), dedicated to exploring the intersection of AI and networking. The WG will focus on standardizing how Kubernetes manages AI-specific traffic, with particular attention to routing, filters, and policy requirements for AI workloads.

The [KubeCon North America 2025 Maintainer Summit CFP](https://sessionize.com/maintainer-summit-na-2025) is open and closes soon on July 20th. Make sure to submit your talks before the deadline!

[LFX Mentorship 2025 Term 3](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2025/03-Sep-Nov) is now open for SIGs to submit mentorship [project ideas](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2025/03-Sep-Nov/project_ideas.md). To propose a project, submit a PR to the project_ideas repository by July 29th 2025. If you have any questions about the LFX mentorship program, feel free to ask in the #sig-contribex.

## Featured PRs

[132832: add SuccessCriteriaMet status for kubectl get job](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132832)

This PR updates the `kubectl get job` output by adding a new `SuccessCriteriaMet` column; This column indicates whether the job has met its success criteria, based on the Job `jobâ€¯successPolicy`; This makes it easier for users to see if a job has satisfied its configured success conditions.

[132838: Drop Deprecated Etcd Flags in Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132838)

This PR removes the usage of two long-deprecated etcd flags in Kubeadm:
  * ```--experimental-initial-corrupt-check```
  * ```--experimental-watch-progress-notify-interval```

These flags were deprecated in etcd `v3.6.0` and removed in `v3.7.0`; The corresponding functionality is now supported via a feature gate **InitialCorruptCheck=true**, and a renamed flag `--watch-progress-notify-interval` (without the experimental prefix).

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4427: Relaxed DNS search string validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4427-relaxed-dns-search-validation/README.md)

This KEP proposes relaxing Kubernetes' strict DNS validation rules for `dnsConfig.searches` in Pod specs. It allows underscores (_) and a single dot (.), which are commonly used in real-world DNS use cases like SRV records or to bypass Kubernetes' internal DNS search paths. Without this change, such configurations are rejected due to [RFC-1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123) hostname restrictions, making it difficult to support some legacy or external systems

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
