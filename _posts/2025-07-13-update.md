## Featured PRs

[132832: add SuccessCriteriaMet status for kubectl get job](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132832)

This PR updates the `kubectl get job` output by adding a new `SuccessCriteriaMet` column; This column indicates whether the job has met its success criteria, based on the Job jobâ€¯successPolicy; This makes it easier for users to see if a job has satisfied its configured success conditions.

[132838: Drop Deprecated Etcd Flags in Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132838)

This PR removes the usage of two long-deprecated etcd flags in Kubeadm:
  * ```--experimental-initial-corrupt-check```
  * ```--experimental-watch-progress-notify-interval```

These flags were deprecated in etcd `v3.6.0` and removed in `v3.7.0`; The corresponding functionality is now supported via a feature gate **InitialCorruptCheck=true**, and a renamed flag `--watch-progress-notify-interval` (without the experimental prefix).
