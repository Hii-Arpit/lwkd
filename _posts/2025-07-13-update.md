[KEP-4427: Relaxed DNS search string validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4427-relaxed-dns-search-validation/README.md)

This KEP proposes relaxing Kubernetes' strict DNS validation rules for `dnsConfig.searches` in Pod specs. It allows underscores (_) and a single dot (.), which are commonly used in real-world DNS use cases like SRV records or to bypass Kubernetes' internal DNS search paths. Without this change, such configurations are rejected due to [RFC-1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123) hostname restrictions, making it difficult to support some legacy or external systems

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
