## Developer News

SIG-PM (Project Management) is [gone now](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/RU8iINF758Y), mostly because the chairs decided that the SIG was redundant with other SIGs, mostly SIG-Arch, but also SIG-Contribex and SIG-Usability.  As part of this, SIG-PM's subprojects, [such as Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1685), have been moved.

Timothy St. Clair [has stepped down from the Steering Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/pull/157) to avoid having too many VMware folks on it.

In last week's [monthly community meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity), we heard from SIG-Docs (who are moving to the Hugo [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/)), SIG-CLI (kubectl moving out of core), and SIG-Node (topology management and RuntimeClass).  Kubernetes will be participating in the [CommunityBridge Mentorships](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/04/16/launching-communitybridge-mentorships-q2-2020/) this term.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, May 5**

We are well into 1.19 now, so get your KEPs and feature proposals ready for what you're working on this term.

Last week we released updates to all supported branches: [1.16.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md/#v1169), [1.17.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md/#v1175), and [1.18.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md/#v1182).  This update fixes a client-go regression, and requires a golang version update for 1.16 and 1.17.

## Featured PRs

### [#90252: Separate go module for tools to avoid polluting root go.mod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90252)

Coming into 1.19 development strong with a big cleanup of developer-only dependencies. These have now been split off into their own file to both reduce repo footprint and reduce downstream dependency complexity.

### [#90010: generate metadata for requiring transition from beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90010)

Along with [#90247](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90247), this adds annotation-driven codegen for tracking the lifecycle of types. The new annotations look like:

```
// +k8s:prerelease-lifecycle-gen:introduced=1.1
// +k8s:prerelease-lifecycle-gen:deprecated=1.8
// +k8s:prerelease-lifecycle-gen:removed=1.18
// +k8s:prerelease-lifecycle-gen:replacement=apps,v1,Deployment
```

and create a `zz_generated.prerelease-lifecycle.go` full of useful information. If you work on any developer tooling which cares about deprecations, check this out.
