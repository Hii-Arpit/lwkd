### [4222: CBOR Serializer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4222-cbor-serializer)

The Kubernetes API has always supported JSON.  JSON is "talky" and requires a lot of CPU to serialize and deserialize large, complex objects, though, so a few years ago we added gRPC support. Binary serialization using gRPC requires a fraction of the CPU time, but requires code generation at build time.  This left CRDs in the slow lane.  Enter [CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)](https://cbor.io/spec.html), an IETF standard, which lets CRDs retain their flexibility while gaining 2X to 8X serialization speed.

CBOR support was proposed by [Ben Luddy in 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4222).  It was planned as Alpha for 1.30, [but is still WIP](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/122921); if you use a lot of CRDs, consider helping Luddy close bugs and write docs.
