The v1.31 release is in full swing now and the enhancements collection is still going on. We currently have 43 enhancements opted in for the release, out of which 20 are in alpha, 9 graduating to beta and 10 graduating to GA. If you are planning to submit a KEP in the v1.31 release, make sure to get a lead-opted-in label for your enhancement from the respective SIG leads and make sure to get your PRR reviews done in time.

## KEP of the Week

### [4222: CBOR Serializer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4222-cbor-serializer)

The Kubernetes API has always supported JSON.  JSON is "talky" and requires a lot of CPU to serialize and deserialize large, complex objects, though, so a few years ago we added gRPC support. Binary serialization using gRPC requires a fraction of the CPU time, but requires code generation at build time.  This left CRDs in the slow lane.  Enter [CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)](https://cbor.io/spec.html), an IETF standard, which lets CRDs retain their flexibility while gaining 2X to 8X serialization speed.

CBOR support was proposed by [Ben Luddy in 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4222).  It was planned as Alpha for 1.30, [but is still WIP](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/122921); if you use a lot of CRDs, consider helping Luddy close bugs and write docs.
