## Developer News

Happy new year!  This is the first LWKD of the new year, so it covers merges and
events from over the holidays.

Tim Hockin has some ideas about [changes to the Alpha/Beta/GA cadence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1roVAHyF7eWZAccmCKw7MXYUNgx4BCDSXF2IMS8h10oY/edit?resourcekey=0-x6Tw2qz1SpCIPhbec6Qa2A). Share your thoughts by commenting.

Tim AllClair proposes [no longer staleifying triaged issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/28266).
Comment on the issue if you're gonna.

Save The Date: the EU Contributor Summit will happen on Tuesday, April 18th, in 
Amsterdam just before [Kubecon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/).  
More information coming soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.27 Release Cycle Begins, January 9th**

We are now [officially in 1.27 development](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Xz8-3jX_Nu8), 
with Xander Grzywinski as release lead, and [lots of other folks backing him up](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.27/release-team.md).

The [call for Enhancements is out](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/_aLqQLywfs0) and they are due February 10th (with PRR a week before that).  See [the release page](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.27) for all the dates of this release cycle, expected to come out on April 11th.

Cherry pick deadline for the January patch releases is this Friday the 13th (so
maybe don't leave it until that day, eh?).  Note that 1.22 is no longer supported,
and 1.23 is in "maintenance mode" (meaning security patches only).
