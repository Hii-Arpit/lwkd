## Developer News

Release Engineering has created a [new `cherry-pick-approved` Prow plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/2083) to [automate approvals](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/U1Na5ce6Mck) for back-patches.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:**


## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 365: Paginated API Lists](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/365-paginated-lists)

This KEP proposes paginating the responses of the Kubernetes API so that it is broken into consistent partial responses. This would allow API consumers to retrieve results in pages to have a lesser impact on the memory usage. Clients that can support this behaviour can opt-in for this by specifying the maximum number of results to return in a `LIST` request. This is critical for large clusters for significantly improving variations in peak memory usage on the API server and to reduce long tail request latency. The design for implementing the pagination as proposed by the KEP involves a `continue` token that would be returned by the server along with the response, if more objects exists than what was requested. The client can send the continue token back to the server to get the next set of results.

This is an older KEP that is graduating to stable in the upcoming v1.29 release.
