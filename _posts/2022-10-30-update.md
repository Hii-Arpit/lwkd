## Developer News

Oct. 24 was the [Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2022/kcsna/).  We started the day with a [call to action from Paris & Tabitha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwpjtGO8dX0), a review of how Japan has hosted their own contributor training, and GitHub staff showing how CodeSpaces for Kubernetes contributors will help people get started.

Here's some session summaries (links require k8s.io/dev membership):

* Discussed [the state of statefulness](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wjJkJiZ0E5GkHb7yXZuiB44cWbcsFjhCmKSCb_3WoE/edit) including the status of features like Taints, PDB, QoS, and slices
* Went over [the limitations of `kubectl apply`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11uwQBr8n5-AaPXccpxrwWZrrwuueAKFmk38Nibn37zI/edit) and how we might solve them
* SIG-Network wants to [run kubemark tests on networking components](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_l1fNeaw_Ob_FzuHX0rd44qSUbbvoXMo0n73kLaFkM/edit#heading=h.a24mnt6kt4vk) at large scale
* Apparently Kubernetes [API user experience is a mess](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UPRiQNwhQVkkLVKM0SGAk8oADIVh88mVzzPl0iD9Y9U/edit)
* Most people don't [understand the real Pod Lifecycle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VsRHJTGy1dKIBVo4nHHgOsKDQKdcYU8_BWG9gJAUVtI/edit), and who can blame them?
* Now that Dockershim is gone, it's time to [completely overhaul how CRI works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6e_gjqMzM7lUllfsBZ53e5W6vdXlI9PqY6Tiyfahq4/edit)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog Freeze, November 2nd**

Today is the time to get in your SIG's blog paragraphs for 1.26.  What exciting features did you merge?  Share it. And then get ready for Code Freeze, which comes in just over a week: November 9th.  CI Signal is green.

November's patch releases have been [rescheduled to November 9th](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) to dodge the US holiday, which means that the cherry-pick deadline is this Friday.

## Featured PRs

### [#105867: Shell completion for plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105867)

While kubectl itself has supported shell completion hooks forever, this has not previously been extended to external plugins. Plugins can now include a `kubectl_complete-<pluginName>` executable while will be called during the normal shell completion processing if required. If you already have kubectl completions installed in your shell, this means as plugins start using this feature, you'll get support for them automatically as well. If you maintain any kubectl plugins, definitely check out this feature.

### [#113015: Custom resource encryption](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113015)

At-rest encryption has been an important feature of Kubernetes for many compliance-sensitive and multi-tenant environments. So far this had been limited to core resources, usually Secrets but sometimes all resources depending on the kube-apiserver configuration. Now this will be available to custom resources as well. This uses the same `EncryptionConfiguration` configuration file, but now with non-core resources groups supported as well. While it may be some time before broad support can be assumed for community projects, this

### [#112377: refactor sets use generic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112377)

The future is now! With Go 1.18, we have support for generics. This PR adds a generics-powered replacement for the old `sets.NewByte()`, `sets.NewInt()`, and `sets.NewString()`: `sets.New[type]()`. For example for strings, `sets.New[string]()` will get you a set just like before. But with less duplicated code. The old APIs are still present to smooth the transition but definitely check out the new tech for new code.
