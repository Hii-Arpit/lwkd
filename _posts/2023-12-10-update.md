## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.29 Released, December 13**

We are still on schedule to release 1.29 this week.

Since new versions of golang can break things in obscure places, we ask the community to please download and test RC2 against your own internal tests, and file issues if you see them.

[Shadow Applications](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-release/c/aHtIDQoLoDk) to join the 1.30 Release Team are open.
