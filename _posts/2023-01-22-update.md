## Developer News

The new [usage metrics project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/usage-metrics-collector) is launched,
and [already has a testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-instrumentation-usage-metrics-collector#periodic-test)

SIG Security wants to know if you're interested in [a Threat Modeling Workshop](https://forms.gle/yAxi1wkq7N3iXQRG6)
at either Contributor Summit this year.

The future of the monthly Community Meeting is unclear; please [provide your insight](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7051).

If you're a SIG Lead, remember that Maintainer Session proposals for Kubecon Amsterdam are due this Friday.
If you're not a lead, but have an idea, tell your SIG lead about it!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Begin PRR reviews, February 2nd**

It's still heavy development time.

Patch releases [1.26.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.25.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), and [1.23.16](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), are out and include updates to Golang, which fix [known security holes](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xrjj-mj9h-534m) came out last week.  These fix multiple important bugs, and
critically [upgrade old versions to Go 1.19](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/RollV1z4fNQ)
to close security holes. Note that 1.22 is now EOL, so it does not have those security fixes;
either upgrade now or get them from distro.

## Featured PRs

### Code Generation Overhaul

Tim Hockin has merged a whole series of PRs to upgrade and improve our automated code generation. This includes [swagger code/data](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115246) fixing the [`go_package` in protobuf files](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115249), disabling [clientset generation for "example" APIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115196) used in tests, and [removing orphaned generated code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115186) which was produced by long-since removed tools and thus hadn't been updated in a long time. There's even more PRs still pending so look forward to another wave of improvements in the coming days. All together this should both speed up codegen and future-proof our build tooling.
