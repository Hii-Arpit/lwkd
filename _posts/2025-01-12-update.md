## Developer News

[Dims has requested](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ng08jZqHI6U) that all SIGs review [their Alpha and Beta features](https://gist.github.com/dims/a0ecf5de51235968e12b9d6b62ac3a83#file-features-md) for ones that are "stuck" and need to advance or be cancelled.

The Kubernetes Github account now has access to [a few new Github Issue features](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-13-evolving-github-issues-public-preview/); sub-issues and advanced search seem particularly useful for us.

Maintainer Track submissions for Kubecon China are [now open](https://sessionize.com/project-lightning-talk-maintainer-track-china25/).  The main track CfPs for [India](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/program/cfp/) and [Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan/program/cfp/) are also open.
