## Developer News

[Dims has requested](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ng08jZqHI6U) that all SIGs review [their Alpha and Beta features](https://gist.github.com/dims/a0ecf5de51235968e12b9d6b62ac3a83#file-features-md) for ones that are "stuck" and need to advance or be removed.

The Kubernetes Github account now has access to [a few new Github Issue features](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-13-evolving-github-issues-public-preview/); sub-issues and advanced search seem particularly useful for us.

Maintainer Track submissions for Kubecon China are [now open](https://sessionize.com/project-lightning-talk-maintainer-track-china25/).  The main track CfPs for [India](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/program/cfp/) and [Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan/program/cfp/) are also open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, February 6**

The January Patch Releases have been [delayed until next week](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/gCrDwbGcQnY).

## Featured PRs

[129543: DRA API: bump maximum size of ReservedFor to 256](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129543)

This PR increases the maximum size of the `ReservedFor` field in the DRA API from
32 to 256 to accommodate larger workloads, such as those involving shared non-local
resources like interconnect channels. This change addresses use cases like NVIDIA GB200
and Google TPU, where a higher limit is necessary for workloads spanning multiple nodes.
Warning: downgrades to Kubernetes `1.32` may be impacted if ResourceClaims
exceed 256.
