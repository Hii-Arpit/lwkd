## Developer News

The [Contributor Celebration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/) has added several planned [activities](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/activities/), including a BakeOff, DevOps party games, arts, and of course the annual contributor awards.  Several events are looking for participants; [register now](https://forms.gle/oAppmLDggEEGx5tz5).

EasyCLA is [not working](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/zdTYKb8VQgo), so we'll be putting off switching CLA bots until after 1.24.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.23.0 Released, Dec. 7!**

1.23 is due out *tommorrow*.  Code Thaw will happen shortly thereafter.

Cherry pick deadline for the December patch releases is this Friday, Dec. 10.


## Merges

* The bump of Dockershim CRI interface from v1alpha2 to v1 was [reverted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106803), because folks didn't feel that it made sense to increment the API one release before we remove it.
* The `gRPC` API field [is now `grpc`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106774) because nobody likes camelacrocase.
