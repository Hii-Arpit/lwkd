## Developer News

We are in **code freeze**.

The [kubernetes-csi/drivers repo has been archived](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2568), since the various CSI drivers have their own repos now.

Please fill out the [contributor survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8scommsurvey2021)!  The project needs this information so we know what parts of Kubernetes' contributor infrastructure and processes to work on for the next year.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze, March 24**

We are currently in Code Freeze, and the 1.21 release has [49 tracked enhancements](https://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements).  If your enhancement isn't on there, file an exception.  You should also have already started on docs for your features and opened an incomplete docs PR.  Release Lead Nabarun Pal [runs down the sequence of events](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/SvtDvel86XU).  We will hit Test Freeze soon, which means you stop trying to expand test coverage for the new release and instead focus on just troubleshooting the [existing test failures](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking).

Speaking of which, these two chronic test issues need more eyeballs; folks are working on them but don't seem to be near a resolution:

* [Subpath container restart](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100194)
* [Exit code for Kubectl Simple Pod test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98854)

Release Burndowns have started, so if you're a SIG lead, it's helpful if you attend at least one a week, particularly if you own current exceptions or failing test jobs.

1.20.5, 1.19.9, 1.18.17 patch releases are due out March 17th.  These will include backports of the [NUMA sockets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99771) and [EndpointSlice cache coherency](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99345) fixes.

## Featured PRs

### Structured Logging for Kubelet

Rather than list the large (and awesome) number of PRs over the past few weeks [upgrading the Kubelet from old-school printf-style logging](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/53) to the new structured syntax, we are going to feature them all together as a group. The overall goal of moving to structured logging is to make the related information on each log line be more accessible to the logging system and its formatters. For the simple text-based format, this ends up looking fairly similar in the end, but now we can output directly to JSON which allows for advanced querying in many log data platforms.

An example of converting an unstructured to structured log:

```diff
- klog.Errorf("Startup probe already exists! %v - %v",
-     format.Pod(pod), c.Name)
+ klog.ErrorS(nil, "Startup probe already exists for container",
+     "pod", klog.KObj(pod), "containerName", c.Name)
```

While the Kubelet was a particular focus for 1.21, the overall goal is to move all logging to the structured format over the next few releases.

### [#98946: Upgrade kustomize-in-kubectl to v4.0.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98946)

An upgrade that has been a long time in the works, the vendored copy of Kustomize is jumping all the way from v2.0.3 to v4.0.5. This applies to both the `kubectl kustomize` command as well as the various `kubectl -k` options on other commands. While the new version brings many improvements, it's also jumping across two major revisions which did include backwards-incompatible changes. If you make heavy use of the built-in Kustomize, you may want to either test with a newer standalone Kustomize before upgrading or set up Kustomize v2.0.3 on its own and switch to using that now so as to smooth out your upgrade process.

### [#96968: Add default namespace labels to all namespaces for selectors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96968)

Namespace selectors are used across many Kubernetes types, both in-tree and community operators. A long-running frustration has been that the second-most common "selector" (after "all namespaces") is "only namespace X". Previously this usually resulted in a quick manual update of the namespace labels with `name: whatever`. Now this will be handled automatically for all namespace objects with a `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label.

* You can only have [one LoadBalancer rule](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99825) in HA mode
* Record the actual auth interval for [authentication_duration_seconds](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99944)
* Prevent EndpointSlice controllers [from creating the same one twice](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100103)
* Scheduler testing [gets a "churn operator"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98900)
* [Count more than 64 CPUs on windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97378), and make sure kubelets [have correct permissions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96616)

## Promotions

* [CSI Service Account Tokens to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99298)

## Version Updates
