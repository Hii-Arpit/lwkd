## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Cycle Starts, January 13**

While we're in the pre-release cycle period, the Release Team is [still looking for a few shadows](https://forms.gle/3xn8fajX1waA8f9m8).  

## Featured PRs

[129119: Fix PodTopologySpread matching pods counts for constraints with the same topologyKey](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129119)

This PR addresses a bug in the Kubernetes scheduler where constraints sharing the same `topologyKey` could incorrectly
overwrite each otherâ€™s results. By updating the `PodTopologySpread` plugin to index data structures by constraint,
it isolates each constraint's results. Additionally, replacing a map with a slice in the PreFilter stage significantly
improves scheduling throughput for pods with topology spreading, boosting performance by up to 25% on large clusters.
This change ensures more accurate scheduling and better resource distribution across nodes.
