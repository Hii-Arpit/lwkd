## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: RC1 released, August 10**

We are in the final countdown to releasing Kubernetes 1.28 on the 15th; test grid looks [mostly OK](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.28-blocking).  Your part of that, aside from responding rapidly to any test failures, is to try out running the RC in your test environment so we can catch any last-minute, showstopper usability issues.

Patch releases for all supported versions should be out this week.  They will include Yet Another GoLang Update.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 3939 - Allow replacement of Pods in a Job when fully terminated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3939-allow-replacement-when-fully-terminated)

This KEP adds a new field to the Kubernetes Jobs API which lets users specify if they want the pods of a job to be recreated as soon as the previous pods are terminating, or only once they've fully terminated. In 1.27, a job is considered to be failed as soon as the job's pods are in terminating state. This KEP lets the user control this behaviour and let them mark the job as failed only after the pods have been terminated. It adds two new API fields, one for configuring whether or not to wait for the terminating pods to finish before creating replacement pods, and another field in Status for tracking the number of terminating pods. This would ensure that the number of pods that are running in the cluster would be the same as what the user specifies at any given time, and hence prevent unnecessary scaling up of the cluster. This KEP was created on [April 4th, 2023 by Kevin Hannon](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3939) and is in alpha in the 1.28 release.
