## Developer News

[Registration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/registration/) for the Salt Lake City Contributor Summit closes Thursday, so don't forget to register; check your email to make sure that you did. Also make sure to add any [Unconference topic](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7993) you have soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, November 8th**

**Code Freeze Is Coming**, and this cycle (because of Kubecon) we'll have test freeze at the same time.  So make sure to get you work on 1.32 features and their tests done this week.  The [removals and deprecations blog post](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7993) has been postponed to this Friday.

And, just to pile it on: patch release cherry-picks are *also* due Friday.
