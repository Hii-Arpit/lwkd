## Developer News

The default branch for [kubernetes/org repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/org) is now "main" instead of "master".  Other kubernetes repos are [likely to follow](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2222) ... eventually.

The Server Side Apply team would like your feedback; [follow their instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121FWis7sIzdG83H9T8G2qvSB6inxJoUub5KsVwFDa60) and take the survey if you write CRDs or other client go code.

The [KIND project has two new maintainers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/2025), and testing-commons subproject, sans maintainers, [is now "best effort"](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5440).  Particularly, if you have testing questions, bring them to the main sig-testing meeting.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Feb 9**

You need to have your enhancement tracked by next Tuesday [using the new process](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Hn1bm9YJP6c/m/Y4d4HcDOBAAJ) to ensure that related PRs will be included in 1.21.  Currently the release has [24 enhancements tracked](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/-nTNtBBHL2Y), but only from 5 SIGs, which says that the rest of y'all aren't paying attention.

[1.21 Alpha 2 is out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), and cherrypick deadline for the next patch releases is Feb 12.
