## Developer News

SIG-Docs [called for Issue Wrangler nominations](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-docs/c/Nqhq-Tk9V7U/m/ttXN7ahEAwAJ). Please reach out to one of the  leads on #SIG-Docs [slack channel](https://slack.k8s.io) if you'd like to volunteer or have any questions around the role.

You have until November 2 to [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcsna/registration/) for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in Chicago.  If you need an exception to attend, you should ask even sooner.

Mike Danese is [stepping down from SIG-Auth leadership](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/YbcO8tEk82U) and has nominated Mo Khan to replace him.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog freeze, October 25th**

Monday was the deadline for Exception Requests; hope you didnâ€™t miss it. You also need your blurbs for the Feature Blog prepared this week, and next week begins Code Freeze.

Patch releases [1.28.3](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/PLiWKzRQOds/m/TMBfN2zUAwAJ), [1.27.7](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/bRFcP62WLRg/m/qsKqQ2nUAwAJ), [1.26.10](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/R8L2sVaL6pc/m/jfI3amXUAwAJ) and [1.25.15](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/bpucSTga8NE/m/wd5eI2XUAwAJ) came out last week. This includes opt-in mitigation for the [HTTPS2 DOS bug](https://issue.k8s.io/121197) as well as golang updates.

## Featured PRs

### [#119026: Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119026)

Networks are, sadly, not instantaneous. And even if they were, light-speed CPUs are also unfortunately unavailable. This has lead to a very common case in Kubernetes where Pods being shut down take some time for that termination to be reflected in places like Service Endpoints, or the proxies using them for Services or Ingresses. In a healthy cluster this delay is short, usually only a few tens of milliseconds, but if the web server software in the Pod stops accepting new connections immediately on receiving SIGTERM this leaves a gap where user connections can be sent to a now-unresponsive socket. The usual workaround for this is to add a `preStop` hook which runs a short sleep, as Endpoints are updated before the `preStop` runs but the SIGTERM isn't delivered until after it completes. Adding 1-2 second sleep ensures the network components have time to process before the socket closes up shop. Up until now this has meant using one of the two modes that container lifecycle hooks offer, either an HTTP GET to an endpoint that doesn't respond for a seconds or exec'ing a sleep binary (or similar shell command) that already exists inside the container. This PR adds a much easier option, a built-in `Sleep` action that doesn't require coordinating support inside the container. This in turn makes it much easier to roll out this mitigation across all Pods in your clusters.

### [#121016: KEP-4008: CRDValidationRatcheting: Ratchet errors from CEL expressions if old DeepEqual](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121016)

While Kubernetes supports strong versioning for API changes, we've always tried to minimize that by using non-disruptive schema change techniques as much as possible. In many controllers this has meant that when we add new validation rules, we only apply them to existing objects if a relevant field is changed. Or in simpler terms, an already-applied object should continue to `kubectl apply` even with new validation rules. This is commonly called "ratcheting" as new objects and changes to existing objects will need to adhere to the new rules (tightening the ratchet) without disrupting all existing objects simultaneously. This PR adds that capability to CEL-based custom type validations. More generally, any existing object fields that aren't changed by a request will not get run through CEL validations. This should also help reduce CPU usage by kube-apiserver for running CEL evaluations. There is future work under the heading of "Advanced Ratcheting", allowing yet more control for cases where new validations _should_ apply even to existing objects, though as a workaround for now you can use validation expressions with the `oldSelf` variable to implement your own logic to enable this.
