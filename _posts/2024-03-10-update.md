## Developer News

The Kuberenetes Contributor Summit is happening next week, on March 19, 2024. We're eagerly looking forward to receiving your contributions to the [unconference topics](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7692).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Draft Doc PRs ,Mar. 12**

Your SIG should be working on any feature blogs, and discussing [what “themes” to feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/2424) in the Release Notes.

## Featured PR

### [#123516: DRA: structured parameters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123516)

DRA, or Dynamic Resource Allocation, is a way to bridge new types of schedulable resources into Kubernetes. A common example of this is GPU accelerator cards but the system is built as generically as possible. Maybe you want to schedule based on cooling capacity, or cash register hardware, or nearby interns, it's up to you. DRA launched as an alpha feature back in 1.26 but came with some hard limitations. Notably the bespoke logic for simulating scale ups and scale downs in cluster-autoscaler had no way to understand how those would interact with these opaque resources. This PR pulls back the veil a tiny bit, keeping things generic but allowing more forms of structured interaction so core tools like the scheduler and autoscalers can understand dynamic resources.

This happens from a few directions. First, on the node itself a DRA driver plugin provides information about what is available locally, which the kubelet publishes as a `NodeResourceSlice` object. In parallel, an operator component from the DRA implementation creates `ResourceClaimParameters` as needed to describe a particular resource claim. The claim parameters include CEL selector expressions for each piece of the claim, allowing anything which can evaluate CEL to check them independently of the DRA plugin. These two new objects combine with the existing `ResourceClaim` object to allow bidirectional communication between Kubernetes components and the DRA plugin without either side needing to wait for the other in most operations.

While this does increase the implementation complexity of a new DRA provider, it also dramatically expands their capabilities. New resources can be managed with effectively zero overhead and without the even greater complexity of custom schedulers or a plugin-driven autoscaler.
