## Featured PRs

[12937: feature(kubectl): support --cpu, --memory flag to kubectl autoscale](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129373)

This PR introduces support for the `--cpu` and `--memory` flags in the kubectl autoscale command; The new flags allow users to specify **CPU** and **Memory** metrics for horizontal pod autoscaling; The update supports both percentage-based utilization and fixed resource values, thus streamlining resource management; This PR also deprecates the `--cpu-percent` flag, following the new approach for defining resource targets.

[132351: bugfix(hpa): introduce buildQuantity helper for consistent resource quantity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132351)

This PR introduces the buildQuantity helper function in the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) controller to ensure consistent handling of resource quantities; Before this change, resource quantities were created inline, which causes inconsistencies in handling CPU and memory metrics; With this update, the buildQuantity function standardizes the process by converting raw memory values to KiB and use BinarySI and handling CPU and other resources in milli-units with DecimalSI; Memory metrics are now displayed correctly in `Ki`, instead of incorrectly appending the “m” suffix thus improving consistency in metric calculations and display.
