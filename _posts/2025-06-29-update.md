## Developer News


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs placeholders, July 3**

[1.34-alpha.2 was released this week](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md#v1340-alpha2), in case you want to play around with the new version.

## Featured PRs

[12937: feature(kubectl): support --cpu, --memory flag to kubectl autoscale](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129373)

This PR introduces support for the `--cpu` and `--memory` flags in the kubectl autoscale command; The new flags allow users to specify **CPU** and **Memory** metrics for horizontal pod autoscaling; The update supports both percentage-based utilization and fixed resource values, thus streamlining resource management; This PR also deprecates the `--cpu-percent` flag, following the new approach for defining resource targets.

[132351: bugfix(hpa): introduce buildQuantity helper for consistent resource quantity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132351)

This PR introduces the buildQuantity helper function in the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) controller to ensure consistent handling of resource quantities; Before this change, resource quantities were created inline, which causes inconsistencies in handling CPU and memory metrics; With this update, the buildQuantity function standardizes the process by converting raw memory values to KiB and use BinarySI and handling CPU and other resources in milli-units with DecimalSI; Memory metrics are now displayed correctly in `Ki`, instead of incorrectly appending the “m” suffix thus improving consistency in metric calculations and display.


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-3902: Decouple Taint-based Pod Eviction from Node Lifecycle Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/3902-decoupled-taint-manager/README.md)

This KEP splits the existing NodeLifecycleController into two controllers: `NodeLifecycleController` (to add taints to unhealthy nodes) and `TaintEvictionController` (to evict pods from tainted nodes).
Previously, both tainting and eviction were handled by a single controller, but the main goal of this change is to separate responsibilities for better clarity, organization, and maintainability.
The new TaintEvictionController is created from existing taint-manager code and now runs separately.
A feature gate called `SeparateTaintEvictionController` lets you enable or disable the new setup.
From Kubernetes v1.29, the taint-based eviction is still enabled by default, but cluster admins can disable the default TaintEvictionController using the `--controllers=-taint-eviction-controller` flag in kube-controller-manager if needed.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
