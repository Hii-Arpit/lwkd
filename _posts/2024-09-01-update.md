### [KEP 4569: Move cgroup v1 support into maintenance mode](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4569-cgroup-v1-maintenance-mode/README.md)

This (KEP) aims to move `cgroup` v1 support in Kubernetes to maintenance mode, aligning with the industry's transition to `cgroup` v2 as the default for Linux kernel resource management. With `cgroup` v2 offering better functionality, consistency, and scalability, and major Linux distributions and projects like `systemd` phasing out `cgroup` v1, Kubernetes must adapt to maintain compatibility and leverage these improvements. This shift reflects the broader ecosystem's move away from `cgroup` v1, making it necessary for Kubernetes to follow suit. Removing cgroup v1 support. Deprecation and removal will be addressed in a future KEP.

This KEP is tracked for stable release in v1.31.
