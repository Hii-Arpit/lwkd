## KEP of the Week
[4138: Pod Conditions for Starting and Completion of Sandbox Creation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3085-pod-conditions-for-starting-completition-of-sandbox-creation)

The KEP proposes to add a pod condition called `PodReadyToStartContainers`. This condition represents the readiness of a pod to start its containers immediately after the successful completion of pod sandbox creation by the Kubelet in Kubernetes.
It aims to provide a clear indication to cluster administrators when the initialization phase of successfully scheduled pods, specifically regarding pod sandbox creation, is completed. Currently, existing conditions such as `PodScheduled` and Initialized do not adequately convey this specific phase of pod lifecycle. With this Enhancement, users can monitor and analyze metrics related to pod sandbox creation latency. This can assist in setting Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and can be used by custom controllers and operators to optimize reconciliation strategies when dealing with pod failures related to sandbox creation.

This KEP is tracked to graduate to beta in the v1.30 release.
