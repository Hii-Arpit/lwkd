## Developer News

We have two new Working Groups, built around the needs of new workloads like AI/ML:

* [WG Device Management](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-device-management) will develop tooling and infrastructure to help users add accelerators and other specialized hardware to their Kubernetes clusters
* [WG Serving](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-serving) will enable AI/ML inference workloads that are not batch-oriented (as a complement to WG Batch)

SIG-Docs is having [almost total leadership turnover](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/aFyRtLOhIJE) with old leaders stepping down, new ones stepping up, and some folks swapping roles.

SIG-Architecture has [published new guidance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7828) for when a feature can skip Alpha release.

**Reminder**: [SIG Annual Reports](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/kAdMGywyFMs) are due by May 1.  It's mostly automated now, so please get it done. Any contributor to the SIG can work on the report, not just the Leads.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: v1.31 cycle starts, May 13th, 2024**

We're in the period between releases. [Shadow applications](https://forms.gle/DwM5SBJ9gCsQJkHbA) for the v1.31 release team are open until May 15. The tentative dates for [the v1.31 cycle](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/nZMtsOyBm0k) are from May 13th to August 15th, 2024.

## KEP of the Week

### [4138: Pod Conditions for Starting and Completion of Sandbox Creation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3085-pod-conditions-for-starting-completition-of-sandbox-creation)

The KEP adds a pod condition called `PodReadyToStartContainers`. It shows pod readiness to start containers immediately after pod sandbox creation. It provides a clear indication to cluster administrators when the initialization phase of successfully scheduled pods is completed. Existing conditions such as `PodScheduled` and Initialized do not adequately convey this specific phase of pod lifecycle. With this Enhancement, users can monitor and analyze pod sandbox creation latency metrics. This can assist in setting Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and can be used by custom controllers and operators to optimize reconciliation strategies for sandbox creation failures.

This KEP is tracked to promote to beta in the v1.30 release.
