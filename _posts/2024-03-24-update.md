## Developer News

Kubernetes Contributor Summit happened last week and was attended by more than 220 contributors. As an event the day before KubeCon EU 2024, we had multiple sessions around the Kubernetes project as well as Q&As with the CNCF team and the Kubernetes Steering committee. There also have been four unconference sessions for example, revisiting Kubernetes hardware resource model. A big thanks to the [community organizers & volunteers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7611).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Day, April 17th**

[Kubernetes 1.30.0-rc.0 is live!](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/cke4ys0RnHM/m/N0p7hae_AwAJ). Also, the docs freeze is now in effect!

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 2876: CRD Validation Expression Language](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/2876-crd-validation-expression-language)

This KEP proposes adding Common Expression Language (CEL) to be integrated into CRDs so that validation can be done without the use of webhooks. It's lightweight and can be run in the kube-apiserver. It also supports pre-parsing and typechecking of expressions, allowing syntax and type errors to be caught at CRD registration time.

This KEP graduated to stable in the v1.29 release.
