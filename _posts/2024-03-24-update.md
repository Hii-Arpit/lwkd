## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 2876: CRD Validation Expression Language](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/2876-crd-validation-expression-language)

This KEP proposes adding Common Expression Language (CEL) to be integrated into CRDs so that validation can be done without the use of webhooks. It's lightweight and can be run in the kube-apiserver. It also supports pre-parsing and typechecking of expressions, allowing syntax and type errors to be caught at CRD registration time.

This KEP graduated to the stable in the v1.29 release.
