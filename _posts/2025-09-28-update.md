## Developer News

Instead of reviving the [WG API Expression](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/VYRaUdf0Arc) working group, a new SIG API Machinery subproject meeting on Declarative APIs and Linters was held on Sept 23, 2025, at 9 AM PST. The subproject carried the same goals as the proposed WG, and meeting details were shared in the [Agenda & Notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYXfDHZpalzoew-PKfgh1XHQB_6JjiEsidsM4zYGAzc/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.xf24wnv1ochq).

The [WG AI Gateway](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/XC_8qAyk8W0) has officially launched with a Slack channel [#wg-ai-gateway](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C09EJTE0LV9) and a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-ai-gateway). Meetings will begin next week, and the community is encouraged to join and participate.
