## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4412: Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4412-projected-service-account-tokens-for-kubelet-image-credential-providers/README.md)

This KEP proposes a secret-less image-pull flow that leverages ephemeral Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens instead of long-lived ImagePullSecrets or node-wide kubelet credential providers. A pod-bound, short-lived KSA token would be used (or exchanged) to obtain transient, workload-scoped image-pull credentials before the pod starts, avoiding persisted secrets in the API or node and allowing external validators to rely on OIDC-like token semantics. This ties image-pull authorization to the workload identity, simplifies secret rotation and management, and reduces the security risk posed by long-lived, hard-to-rotate credentials.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
