[134330: Add resource version comparison function in client-go along with conformance](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134330)

This PR introduces a helper function for comparing Kubernetes resource versions; Resource versions are used for concurrency control and watch operations, but until now, they could only be compared as opaque strings; The new function allows direct comparison of resource versions for objects of the same type; Alongside this, conformance tests have been added to ensure consistent handling across GA resources, making resource version behavior clearer and more reliable.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4412: Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4412-projected-service-account-tokens-for-kubelet-image-credential-providers/README.md)

This KEP proposes a secret-less image-pull flow that leverages ephemeral Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens instead of long-lived ImagePullSecrets or node-wide kubelet credential providers. A pod-bound, short-lived KSA token would be used (or exchanged) to obtain transient, workload-scoped image-pull credentials before the pod starts, avoiding persisted secrets in the API or node and allowing external validators to rely on OIDC-like token semantics. This ties image-pull authorization to the workload identity, simplifies secret rotation and management, and reduces the security risk posed by long-lived, hard-to-rotate credentials.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
