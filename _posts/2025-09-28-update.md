## Developer News

Instead of reviving the [WG API Expression](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/VYRaUdf0Arc) working group, a new SIG API Machinery subproject meeting on Declarative APIs and Linters was held on Sept 23, 2025, at 9 AM PST. The subproject carried the same goals as the proposed WG, and meeting details were shared in the [Agenda & Notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYXfDHZpalzoew-PKfgh1XHQB_6JjiEsidsM4zYGAzc/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.xf24wnv1ochq).

The [WG AI Gateway](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/XC_8qAyk8W0) has officially launched with a Slack channel [#wg-ai-gateway](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C09EJTE0LV9) and a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-ai-gateway). Meetings will begin next week, and the community is encouraged to join and participate.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, October 9**
Kubernetes v1.35 is moving along — APAC-friendly meetings are running and enhancement opt-ins are open.

If you’re an enhancement owner, make sure your KEP is up to date (status: implementable,milestone: v1.35, test plan + PRR filled) before [PRR Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#prr-freeze) on Oct 9 (AoE) / Oct 10, 12:00 UTC.

The next cherry-pick deadline for patch releases is Oct 10

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4412: Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4412-projected-service-account-tokens-for-kubelet-image-credential-providers/README.md)

This KEP proposes a secret-less image-pull flow that leverages ephemeral Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens instead of long-lived ImagePullSecrets or node-wide kubelet credential providers. A pod-bound, short-lived KSA token would be used (or exchanged) to obtain transient, workload-scoped image-pull credentials before the pod starts, avoiding persisted secrets in the API or node and allowing external validators to rely on OIDC-like token semantics. This ties image-pull authorization to the workload identity, simplifies secret rotation and management, and reduces the security risk posed by long-lived, hard-to-rotate credentials.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
