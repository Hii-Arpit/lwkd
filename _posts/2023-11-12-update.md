Etcd is now [officially a SIG](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/07/introducing-sig-etcd/), rejoining Kubernetes after four years apart. Tim Hockin and Patrick Ohly have proposed a [DRA Working Group](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/BDtCFfXQbw0).

The [four prior leads for ContribEx](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7603) have retired, being replaced with new leads Nabarun Pal, Kaslin Fields, Priyanka Saggu, and Madhav Jivrajani.  Dan Winship has joined SIG-Network as a Tech Lead.

Following up on the [WG-LTS session at KCS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o9exYWgsn3PWmIiCZvrBpI6nlaj_8e-ZHgvl8ozNrPQ/edit), the [LTS Survey](http://bit.ly/k8s-upgrade-survey) is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Draft Doc PRs and Major Themes due, Nov. 14**

We are [more than halfway to the release](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uwx7-Ra-Dr8), with 46 tracked enhancements. Your SIG should be working on any feature blogs, and discussing [what "themes" to feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/2271) in the Release Notes.

## Featured PRs

### [#121837: kubeadm: change SystemPrivilegedGroup in apiserve-kubelet-client.crt](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121837)

This PR fixes a bug where the "system:masters" group was being used in the apiserve-kubelet-client certificate specification. This group is too privileged and should be used less frequently. It also changes the group to "kubeadm:cluster-admins" which is a less privileged group. This group is still able to perform all of the necessary tasks, but it does not have the same level of access as the "system:masters" group.

Furthermore, It also adds a test to ensure that the "kubeadm:cluster-admins" group is always present when the certificate is updated or regenerated. This will help to prevent the problem of the certificate being updated to use the "system:masters" group if the "kubeadm:cluster-admins" group is not present.
