In case you somehow missed it, [Kubernetes 1.10 has been released](https://blog.kubernetes.io/2018/03/kubernetes-1.10-stabilizing-storage-security-networking.html).  Go grab it, you can read LWKD while it deploys.

## Community Meeting Summary

[Andy Goldstein](https://github.com/ncdc) kicked off the [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY) with a demo of Heptio's [Ark](https://github.com/heptio/ark), a tool that lets you back up your Kubernetes cluster, including configurations and PVs.  Or, at least it will once it's done; they're looking for contributors.

[Cole Mickens](https://github.com/colemickens) gave SIG-Azure's update. They are moving the Azure CloudProvider to its own repo.  There are a lot of Azure compatibilty features in 1.10, and more planned for later relases.  [SIG-Node's update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P267xBGQtLprbVV-XStpVt8c-um6NqBmQLEIOKhmJAs/edit?usp=sharing) from [Derek Carr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr) included the new [CRI Testing Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/cri-testing-policy.md), local storage isolation, debug containers, and container log rotation.  He applauded the [Resource Mangement Workgroup](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-resource-management) for getting CPU pinning, hugepages, and device plugins into beta for 1.10.  SIG-Node is working on their SIG charter, as well as a secure container spec.  Finally, [Casey Davenport](https://github.com/caseydavenport) of SIG-Network explained their [current efforts to convert internal Kubernetes communications to IPv6](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/508), the upcoming switch from kube-dns to CoreDNS, and their work on implementing IPVS support for kube-proxy, which has [run into some snags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fipvs) and is currently stalled.  They did a survey in February on how people use Ingress and [shared the results](https://github.com/bowei/k8s-ingress-survey-2018).


## Release Schedule

1.10 [has been released](https://blog.kubernetes.io/2018/03/kubernetes-1.10-stabilizing-storage-security-networking.html).  Release 1.11, "Everything Croissant" is scheduled for June 2018, with Josh Berkus as the release lead.

The following patch releases are available: 1.9.6, 1.8.10, and 1.7.15.  Version 1.9.6 contains a number of fixes to make it possible to downgrade from 1.10 to 1.9 if necessary.  As such, users should make sure to target 1.9.6 if they have to roll back a 1.10 deployment.

## Final 1.10 Items

The release of 1.10 involved some last-minute fixes, including:

* Our GCE support was using an alpha image of Ingress, which we [replaced with the 1.0.0 image](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61302)
* The Daemonset Scheduling feature had to be [rolled back because of test fails](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61411) and postponed to 1.11.
* We continue to patch side effects from [securing subpaths](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-announce/6sNHO_jyBzE), such as [fixing subpath volume names](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61373).
* Fixed [pod CPU quotas](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61294).
* Update 1.9.6 to [support removal of PV Protection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61370).

There were also a bunch of major performance regressions which held up 1.10 release.  Thanks to the heroic folks at SIG-scalability for fixing these and if you're a performance geek they could use you. Among them:

* [Fix Fluentd scaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61225)
* [Prevent extra kubectl traffic](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/pull/125)

... but 1.10 still increases resource usage, so that's something which needs future work.

## 1.11 Feature Work

And 1.11 is off!

* [Several](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61501) [communication](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61496) [channels](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61440) to support [pretty-printing for custom objects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZZFVe9oD1KQmk5uExggRWtRl_hKGfYnBXvHZJlgEro/edit#).
* kubectl label is [clearer and more useful](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58353).
* Create a [performance test framework for the IPAM controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61143).
* `kubectl patch` [now has "--dry-run"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60675).

## Deprecated

* The popular `--show-all` switch for kubectl [has been disabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60793) because its output was never consistent or logical.
* kubectl [doesn't support specifying custom scalers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60455) anymore.  Betcha didn't know it did in the first place, eh?
* No more [--storage-version for kube-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61453)
* `--service-account-private-key-file` is [gone from the kube-controller-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60875).

## Version Updates.

* [Cluster Autoscaler to 1.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61561)

## Other Merges

* More subpath fixes: [Unix sockets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61480)
* Better [admission controller settings](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61427) for Juju clusters.
