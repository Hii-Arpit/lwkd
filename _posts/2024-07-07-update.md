## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4639: Add OCI VolumeSource CRI API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4639-oci-volume-source)

The OCI has [added a spec for "artifacts"](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2024-03-13-image-and-distribution-1-1/#artifacts) being distributed as container images.  With this KEP, Kubernetes will be taking advantage of the new capabilities as a way of distributing shared files to pods.  It adds a new VolumeSource type of OCIObject, which can then get pulled down and mounted as a filesystem just like other volumes.  This can be used for secrets, large data blobs, and shared configuration file sets.

[An API was merged last week](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125659), and a full alpha release is planned for 1.31.
