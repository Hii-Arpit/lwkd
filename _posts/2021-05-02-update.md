## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, May 13**

Get your Enhancement plans registered during the week after KubeCon.  Also, [1.22 Alpha 1 is out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), which mostly means the stuff that was held back during Code Freeze. Note that this already involves [one incompatible change](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95387).

KubeCon or not, your cherry-picks for the next Patch Releases are due Friday.  That release, which will include the last patch for 1.18, will come out next week.

## Other Merges

* The utility function NewSelfSignedCACert [has been updated to be compatible with Go 1.15's new rules on certificate validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100324).
* Some metrics to track [certs which would violate Go 1.15's new rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95396).
* LoadBalancer services on AWS [will call the API in chunks of 100 updates](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101592) to improve reliability.
* Quick fix [for `userspace` proxy mode when using EndpointSlices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100913) by not using them.
