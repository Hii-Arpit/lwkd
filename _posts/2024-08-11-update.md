In addition to the list of features in the main blog post, note that [cgroups v1 is going into maintenance](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/14/kubernetes-1-31-moving-cgroup-v1-support-maintenance-mode/), several things [have been removed](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/) (most notably Ceph in-tree driver), and the addition of [lastTransitionTime](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/14/last-phase-transition-time-ga/) for PVs.  More 1.31 features below.

[Steering Committee nominations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2024#candidacy-process) are open.

The Kubernetes Contributor Summit is looking for [artists to create designs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/wHq4qFsRljs). [Registration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/registration/) and [CfP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqdvHnS4HVZQXdBmZHClgUbAodxEGH18t365qqdgtn0hhx-Q/viewform) is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: v1.31.0 release day, August 13th**

Kubernetes 1.31 was released on August 13.  

Patch releases are expected later this week.

## Lesser-known 1.31 Features

These features didn't make the 1.31 release blog, but are interesting to contributors:

### [4355: Coordinated Leader Elections](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4355)

This Enhancement makes control plane leader elections function in a way that is compatible with upgrading one control plane component at a time, by keeping everyone on the old APIserver until everything else is upgraded.  This should make for a smoother, and more reliable, upgrade experience.  Alpha and opt-in only for 1.31.

### [4368: Job API managed-by mechanism](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4368)

A small part of the [MultiKueue initiative](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/tree/main/keps/693-multikueue) of the Kueue job manager, this enhancement adds tracking for which controller "owns" a job.  While potentially useful for any multi-controller environment, the change is intended to make multi-cluster job scheduling possible.  Alpha in 1.31.

### [4176](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4176) and [4622](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4622): HPC Features

Two features make Kubernetes more useful on bigger, beefier machines.  We can spread hyperthreads across physical CPUs, making better use of high-core-count machines.  And we can configure topology rules for more than eight NUMA nodes, supporting very high memory systems.  4176 is Alpha and 4622 is Beta in 1.31.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4420: Retry Generate Name](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4420-retry-generate-name)

This KEP implements automated retry of `generateName` create requests when a name conflict occurs. Despite generating over 14 million possible names per prefix with a 5-character random suffix, conflicts are frequent, with a 50% chance after 5,000 names. Currently, a conflict triggers an `HTTP 409` response, leaving it to clients to retry, which many fail to do, causing production issues.

This feature became Beta in 1.31.

## Subprojects and Dependency Updates

* [containerd v1.6.35](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.35) regenerate UUID if state is empty in introspection service
* [prometheus v2.54.0](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.54.0) remote-Write: Version 2.0 experimental, plus metadata in WAL via feature flag metadata-wal-records; also [v2.53.2](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.53.2)
