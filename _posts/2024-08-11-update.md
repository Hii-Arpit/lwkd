## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 4420: Retry Generate Name](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4420-retry-generate-name)

This KEP introduces that Kubernetes automatically retry `generateName` create requests when a name conflict occurs. Despite generating over 14 million possible names per prefix with a 5-character suffix, conflicts are frequent, with a 50% chance after `5,000` names. Currently, a conflict triggers an `HTTP 409` response, leaving it to clients to retry, which many fail to do, causing production issues.
