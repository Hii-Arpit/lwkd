[KEP-4009: Add CDI devices to device plugin API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4009-add-cdi-devices-to-device-plugin-api)

This KEP proposes **extending** the **Device Plugin API** in Kubernetes to include a field for specifying **Container Device Interface (CDI) device IDs** in the `AllocateResponse`. This addition allows device plugin implementations to **uniquely specify devices** using their fully-qualified CDI device names, simplifying the process of **injecting devices** into containers. 

The motivation behind this change is to align Kubernetes with the **CDI standard**, which provides a standardized way for device vendors to describe resource requirements and access to specific devices. The CDI device IDs are included in the response from the device plugin and forwarded to the **CRI runtimes** for container execution. 

This KEP outlines the design details, test plan, graduation criteria, and production readiness review for this enhancement, with a focus on ensuring compatibility and minimal impact on existing components. The goal is to enable device plugin authors to leverage CDI for device injection without necessitating a shift to **Dynamic Resource Allocation** (DRA) based implementations. 

In essence, this enhancement contributes to improving the management of devices in containerized environments within Kubernetes. 

This KEP was authored by  and received `alpha` milestone `v1.28`.
