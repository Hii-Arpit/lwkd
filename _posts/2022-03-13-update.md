## Developer News

Happy [Pi(e) Day!](https://twitter.com/parisinbmore/status/974003360071172096)

The [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit) is this Thursday at 1700 UTC/10:00PDT.  Join us!

It's been one year since we [changed the release cadence for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-release/2572-release-cadence) from 3 months to 4 months. Which means it's time to [survey how you feel about that](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8s-cadence-2022). Please let us know!  Is 3 releases a year better?

We've [started a further discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ai8SetaxYuk) around what it would take to improve Kubernetes reliability.

Do you need to survey the Kubernetes community for your SIG or WG? Contact SIG-ContribEx on Slack or [file a survey request issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcontributor-comms%2C+sig%2Fcontributor-experience&template=survey-request.yml&title=SURVEY+REQUEST%3A+%3Ctopic%3E). We can help you design and promote your community survey, and we have the official SurveyMonkey account.

Speaking of surveys, a Florida University student wants to [find out how you feel about our Github bots](https://fiu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8wCAtRDNHyR7zTM).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions Due, March 21st**

We are now in the final week for any [Enhancement Exceptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md#exceptions-to-milestone-enhancement-complete-dates) you might need; otherwise the [list of what's being included](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T21mUTvPh70NB2eseHjCyD4LgRjyxWI9Bd1SoP8zAwA/edit#gid=0) and what's being bounced is pretty final. 68 tracked enhancements, plus 25 that have been removed from 1.24. Code Freeze comes on March 29th.

TestGrid does [not look good](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) anymore.  We have six flaky and one failing job in master-blocking. If the release were next week, we'd be delaying it.  Please check if your team owns any failing/flaking tests.

Patch updates for all supported versions (1.23, 1.22, and 1.21) are due out this week.  Per earlier LWKDs, there's a lot of backported bug fixes in these.
