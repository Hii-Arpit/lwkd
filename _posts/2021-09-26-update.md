## Developer News

The annual [Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2021) has begun.   You may nominate candidates (including yourself) to run for SC until October 14th.  
Now is also the time to check your eligibility, either via [voters.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2021/voters.yaml) or the new [Elekto App](https://elections.k8s.io/), and file an Exception if necessary. Voting will be from Oct 18 to Nov 4.

[SIG-CLI leadership changes](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/pYQ1iNgpzNg): 
Katrina Verey will be Tech Lead and chair, Maciej Szulik will be TL only, and Phil Wittrock is retiring.

Divya Mohan is the new [SIG-Docs co-chair](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Q6BlRHnNKho).

SIG-Testing has separated [its Chairs from its Tech Leads](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/YT9IwOaJ4ZU), 
including adding Cole Wagner and Alvaro Aleman as TLs.

## KubeCon Contributor Activities

There will be [no formally organized Contributor Summit](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/e7xIp2Mz398) this year due to low attendance in Los Angeles.  However, there will still be two rooms and multiple tables available for SIG meetings and work sessions, [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FSNUEUhNxgBgWGDC95EVg1iWGRoFCSVfk5lF2lZ9h-k/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to "reserve" one.  SIG-Contribex will be holding a [Contributor Workshop Doc Sprint](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-contribex/c/Pg54SiCDFDQ) from 10am-4pm, in order to whip the "how to contribute" website into shape.

The SIG Meet-and-Greet is [scheduled for Wednesday at 1:30pm](https://kccncna2021.sched.com/event/luKT?iframe=no); your SIG should attend and recruit new contributors!

We will still be having a Contributor Social, with bowling, on Monday night; 
[RSVPs required here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FSNUEUhNxgBgWGDC95EVg1iWGRoFCSVfk5lF2lZ9h-k/edit?usp=sharing).  And we're still planning the online Contributor Celebration in December.
