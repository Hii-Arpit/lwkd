## Developer News

SIG-K8s-Infra is [moving multiple Prow jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/117749) to the donated build cluster on AWS.

Jeremy Rickard has proposed specifics for the revived [WG-LTS](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/qWsMPMDqCFQ).

Daniel Smith [has stepped down](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/BlEn6l68nzE) as API-Machinery Tech Lead, and nominated Joe Betz as his replacement.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.28 Cycle Begins, May 15th**

The cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is this Friday.

## Featured PR

### [#116779: Controlled rollout of CEL libraries and language features](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116779)

While the multitude of new CEL-based features has been well received, one open question has been how to evolve the CEL-facing API in a way that satisfies our compatibility requirements. This PR moves us a lot closer to that goal. It adds two distinct environments, NewExpressions for new data and StoredExpressions for existing data in etcd. This allows for slow releases of new functionality, a new CEL field or function can be exposed over time. Look for a future PR to go deeper into features like feature gates for individual CEL functions or potentially API stability tagging for CEL functions.
