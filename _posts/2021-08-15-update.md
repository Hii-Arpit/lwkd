## Developer News

Anubhav Vardhan has [restarted the effort to localize](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/29353) the Kubernetes docs to Hindi.  If you write that language, please consider helping out.

[Registration is open](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcsna2021/registration/) for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in LA and online; please register whether you'll be there in person or internet.  Also, please [propose a session](https://forms.gle/bt3CvN4LnrU9iCcg6).  The summit will include a couple general sessions, a lot of "unconference" style sessions, a couple workshops, and some SIG face-to-face meetings, and you can use that form to propose all of those.

Timothy St. Clair has stepped down from SIG-Cluster-Lifecycle, and nominated [Vince Prignano](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/rj7aRO1JPnA) to the chair.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.23 Cycle Begins, August 23**

Roughly one week after the [new release cycle begins](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.23), the Production Readiness Review team [would like to have all of your requests to review KEPs](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-architecture/c/a6_y81N49aQ). They realize this is an early deadline, and [call for shadows](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md#becoming-a-prod-readiness-reviewer-or-approver) to learn PRR so that they can expand bandwidth for KEP review.

Patch versions [1.19.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md), [1.20.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), and [1.21.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md) came out last week. Changes consist primarily of updating the Go version, with a few miscellaneous bug fixes.

## Featured PRs

### [#103918: Allow customizing spam filtering in event client library](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103918)

The Events subsystem has many protections to keep the flood of data from overwhelming kube-apiserver. Two major ones are implemented in the event recorder system in client-go, deduplication and rate limiting. While duplication checks the whole event struct, the rate limiting system has, so far, only looked source and involved object. This can now be customized for situations where rate limits should also take into account other data such as the event Reason field (different Reasons could be bucketed separately). When constructing the recorder, you can now specify a `SpamKeyFunc` in the correlator options to provide your own stringification, including whichever data is important for your use case.

### [#104030: Refactor defaultpreemption for out-of-tree plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104030)

A number of utility functions for managing preemption in scheduler plugins have been shuffled into their own package to make it easier for out-of-tree consumers. If you were previously importing helpers from `scheduler/framework/plugins/defaultpreemption`, check out the new and improved versions!
