## Developer News

LWKD is looking for new/additional writers.  We would love to have more folks who can help us produce LWKD, and add important coverage for Kubernetes developers, such as [current KEPs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lwkd/issues/206) or [Kubernetes subprojects](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lwkd/issues/205); volunteer on those issues.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog Freeze, July 10**

Monday was the deadline for Exception Requests; hope you didn't miss it. You also need your blurbs for the Feature Blog prepared this week, and next week begins Code Freeze.

Patch releases for all supported versions are expected out this Wednesday.  This will be the last patch set for 1.24; if you are still using 1.24, plan your upgrade now.
