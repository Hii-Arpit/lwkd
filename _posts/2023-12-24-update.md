## Featured PRs

### [#44478: Add shortcode to generate Feature gates tables](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44478)

Major work has been done to facilitate the generation of the [feature gates reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) in the Kubernetes website from [information stored in feature description files](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/25645). Custom Hugo shortcodes for generating feature gates tables have been added in this PR. The new `feature-gate-table` shortcode generates feature gate tables for features in Alpha or Beta, graduated or deprecated features, as well as feature gates that are removed. The shortcode also validates the name of the stage and the format of the version in the feature description file. This PR builds on top of [#41793 Switch to per-file feature gate descriptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/41793), which added a shortcode to render feature gate descriptions. 

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4020: Unknown Version Interoperability Proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4020-unknown-version-interoperability-proxy)

This KEP proposes to solve an issue that arises when multiple API servers are running in a cluster, and specifically when they are not all serving the same set of API versions. That situation can happen when a cluster upgrade / downgrade is happening, or during the rollout of a a runtime configuration change. All the different API servers might not be able to serve all the resources in all the different versions. This proposed filter will proxy clients to an API server that is capable of handling the request from the client. The KEP proposes to use the existing `StorageVersion` information in each API server's discovery document to figure out which group, version and resource types an API server can serve. If the API server doesn't have the requested group/version/resource locally, the request will be proxied to one of the API servers listed in the `ServerStorageVersion` data.

This KEP was in alpha stage in the v1.28 release
