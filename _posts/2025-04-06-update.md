## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release day, April 23**

Kubernetes [v1.33.0-rc.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md) is now available for your testing pleasure.

We are less than two weeks away from the scheduled release date for Kubernetes v1.33!

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3619: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups control](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3619-supplemental-groups-policy)

This KEP adds a new way to choose correct behaviour with how container runtimes are applying SupplementalGroups to the first container process. Previous to this KEP, supplemental groups attached to containers were defined at two levels in Kubernetes - the OCI image level as well as the Kubernetes API level. The Kubernetes API level `PodSecurityContext.{RunAsUser, RunAsGroup, SupplementalGroups}` was designed to override the `config.User` configuration of OCI images. But in the current implementation, even if supplemental groups are defined at the Kubernetes API level, the group memberships defined in the container image for the UID are attached to the container process. This KEP proposes changes to both the Kubernets API and the CRI API to fix this issue.

This KEP is driven by [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace) and is tracked to graduate to beta in the v1.33 cycle.
