## Developer News

[Kubernetes version 1.26 "Electrifying"](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/09/kubernetes-v1-26-release/) is now available.  The biggest thing in this release is both the number of features reaching maturity/GA, and the number of obsolete APIs and deprecated features being removed.  Make sure you read the [release notes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/09/kubernetes-v1-26-release/)

The names of the [presubmit tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/28176) have been changed to better reflect what they actually test.

David Tesar is [proposing to add workflow labelling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6999) for Kubernetes PRs, with the idea of allowing people to check status less often.  Please provide feedback so that we can build something that actually works. ContribEx would also like to [discuss retaining LGTM through squashes](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22663) in order to reduce repeat-LGTMs.
