## Developer News

The [Steering Committee nominations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2024#candidacy-process) are open until August 24.  Currently there are [four candidates](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+steering+committee+nomination+created%3A%3E2024-08-01) running for three seats.  If you are a candidate, or thinking of running, [join current Steering members for a Q&A](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/5cRPpyBadqE/m/maNY1NikBwAJ).

All Kubernetes GitHub orgs have [been moved under our enterprise account](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/59Huu9dbqXQ/m/f7XvYOYNAgAJ).  However, [the Prow migration](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/qzNYpcN5la4) starts August 21, so subprojects should hold off on releases until it's complete.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.32 cycle begins, September 9**

Kubernetes [v1.31.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.31.0) is live and the latest!  The 1.32 release cycle [will begin soon](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/2604), with Release Team Lead Federico Mu√±oz.

The latest patch releases [v1.28.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.28.13), [v1.29.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.29.8) and [v1.30.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.30.4) are available.

The Release Team Shadow applications are now [live](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb60FW9aYIepSdXIWexQIKNJ8m3JSqHZ6kkH3Q_I7XP9OVYA/viewform). This form will close on Friday, September 06, 2024. Selected applicants will be notified by the end of the day, Friday, September 13, 2024.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md)

The KEP creates a new `nftables` backend for kube-proxy on Linux to replace the current `iptables` and `ipvs` backends. `iptables`, the default backend, suffers from unfixable performance issues, such as slow rule updates and degraded packet processing as the ruleset grows. While it is hoped that this backend will eventually replace both the iptables and `ipvs` backends and become the default kube-proxy mode on Linux, that replacement/deprecation would be handled in a separate future KEP.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
