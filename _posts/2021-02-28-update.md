## Developer News

If you contribute to Kubernetes or its subprojects and dependancies, please take [The Annual Contributor Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8scommsurvey2021).

Our infra team is [ditching Bazel](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99561) from Kubernetes core builds.  See below for details.

SIG-Node [wants your use-case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZtRtC8W8FwW_VWQLKP9DW_2H-hcLBcH9KBbukie67M/edit#heading=h.8ilpribw5jbx) for implementing swap support.

SIG-ContribEx wants to remind you [Kubernetes is an inclusive space](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/XHoHt4srWfc).

You have until March 9th to [submit some GSOC project ideas](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/master/summerofcode/2021.md#project-ideas) if your SIG or subproject has potential mentors.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, March 9th**

Code Freeze is coming!  That means it's time to finish up those PRs for all those [enhancements](https://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements) you've been working on.  1.21 is just around the corner!  The [first beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.21.0-beta.0) is already out for testing.

Also, the cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is March 12th.

## Featured PRs

### [#99561: Remove Bazel](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99561)

After months of preparation, the day is finally here! Bazel is being removed as the build system for Kubernetes itself, in favor of the existing `make build` tooling that releases have always used. While this should be mostly transparent, if you have any PRs in progress that include BUILD changes you will need to fix up your branch. To do this:

1. Fetch and rebase against upstream.
2. Run `hack/update-bazel.sh` during your rebase which will now auto-remove any lingering changes in your PR once the updated script merges in #99561. This script should only take about one second to run.
3. Carry on as usual.

If you have any questions about the new Bazel-free world, you can ask [on k-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/tRqW6b7gPMA) or [on Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C09R23FHP). The future is now!

### [#99163: Implements pod deletion cost](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99163)

One of the problem with Deployments is that during evictions or terminations, the pod to remove is selected semi-randomly. This can lead to frustration when a better strategy is available with the full picture of the application, for example preferring to scale down on ephemeral cloud instances before longer-lasting ones. Now you can communicate that information down to the controller via a `controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost: "123"` Pod annotation. The string'd numeric value can be any int32 so you can devise whatever numbering scheme your systems require, and apply the annotations from your own controller(s).

### [#99467: Remove KubeDescribe from SIGDescribe calls](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99467)

To streamline the tracking of e2e tests, SIG-Testing is [requiring all tests be owned by a specific SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98326). Additionally some new restrictions to ensure each test is unambiguously owned by only one SIG will be put in place, the bulk of which is fixed up by this PR. If you are responsible for one of the remaining unowned tests, please work with SIG-Testing to get it labelled appropriately.
