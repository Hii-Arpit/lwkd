## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP 4633: Only allow anonymous auth for configured endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4633-anonymous-auth-configurable-endpoints/README.md)

This KEP proposes allowing anonymous authentication only for specified endpoints while disabling it elsewhere. Kubernetes permits anonymous requests by default, but fully disabling them (`--anonymous-auth=false`) can break unauthenticated health checks (`healthz`, `livez`, `readyz`). Misconfigurations, like binding `system:anonymous` to powerful roles, pose security risks. This proposal enhances security by minimizing misconfigurations while preserving essential functionality.
