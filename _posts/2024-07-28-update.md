## Featured PRs

### [#125663: # [KEP-4639] Add `ImageVolumeSource` API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125663)

While the API types [were added a few weeks ago](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125660), this PR adds the implementation for the new `image` volume type. While this feature has existed in Docker for many years, and through CSI plugins for nearly as long, this will bring into Kubernetes core and make it much more accessible to users. The general idea is simple, mounting a container image into a path so they can be updated independently of the running container image. For example a machine learning service can load its model files from an image updated nightly without having to recertify the code, or a CI system can load tools from an arbitrary image without having to worry about specifics.

This uses the same image management systems as everything else in the Kubelet, so images will be cached and reused if desired, and pull credentials are used automatically:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: tools
  image:
    reference: mytools:1.2.3
    pullPolicy: Always # or IfNotPresent (optional)
```

### [#124012: # Coordinated Leader Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124012)

The lease-based leader election framework built into Kubernetes has proven to be robust and powerful even in high-churn environments. What it isn't, however, is predictable. This can increase the stress of running control plane upgrades, especially during version changes in extremely-low-downtime situations. This PR extends the existing leader election system with a new mode, `strategy: OldestEmulationVersion`, which provides for a default-case behavior where leaders are selected based on "simple" criteria (specifically a cascading choice list based on the declared API emulation version, actual version of the server, and creation timestamp of a new `LeaseCandidate` object) so that during upgrade we minimize leader swaps and they can also be generally predictable. This is built on top of all the existing machinery, so if something does go very wrong, we'll still have that same robust safety we're all accustomed to, but with a much easier happy path.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 2644: Honor Persistent Volume Reclaim Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/2644-honor-pv-reclaim-policy)

This KEP introduces an enhancement to Kubernetes by ensuring that the PV reclaim policy is honored even if the PV is deleted before the PVC. For a `bound` PV-Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) pair, if the PVC is deleted before the PV, the reclaim policy is honored. However, if the PV is deleted before the PVC, the reclaim policy is not exercised, leaving the storage asset not removed.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
