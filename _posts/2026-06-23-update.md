## Developer News

Reminder: all jobs on the old test cluster must migrate or die by August 1.  [Here's a table](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/docs/job-migration-todo.md) of unmigrated jobs.  While you're at it, start working on [using `--label-filter`](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uBP23XSbypo) to revise how Prow runs your tests.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4193: Bound service account token improvements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/4193-bound-service-account-token-improvements/)

This (KEP) aims to bind Pod's associated Node information into Kubernetes service account tokens, enhancing their security and traceability. By embedding the Node's name and UID into the JWT tokens and including unique identifiers (JTIs), the KEP ensures robust identity verification and improves auditability. This includes extending the TokenRequest API to bind tokens to Node objects and modifying the TokenReview API to validate these tokens. These changes support mitigating replay attacks and improving the overall security posture of Kubernetes clusters by providing a clear, traceable link between tokens and their originating Node objects.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
