## Developer News

The Kubernetes SIG Release main meeting has been rescheduled, based on a community vote, to a fixed time slot of Thursdays from 2:30–3:15 pm UTC, starting August 21, 2025, and will now follow a bi-weekly cadence. The previously alternating meeting times are discontinued, and the next scheduled meeting before the change has been canceled. The time is tied to UTC, so participants in regions with Daylight Saving Time may see a ±1 hour shift. The [calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has been updated, and questions or feedback can be shared via email or the [#sig-release](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C2C40FMNF) Slack channel.
