## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, June 12**

Once you get done putting info in your KEPs for [production readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#prr-freeze), you'll be ready for the [Enhancements Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) 8 days later.  Now's the time to decide whether your enhancement is [tracked for 1.34 or not](https://bit.ly/k8s134-enhancements).

Patch releases on all versions are due out June 10.

## Featured PRs

[131632: feat: Allow leases to have custom labels set when a new holder takes the lease](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131632)

This PR allows users to set custom labels on LeaseLock resources when a new holder acquires the lease; users can now track which node holds the lease, thus improving observability for components using leader election.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 3015: PreferSameZone and PreferSameNode Traffic Distribution](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/3015-prefer-same-node)

This enhancement deprecated the `PreferClose` Pod Topology Spread Constraints type and replaced it with `PreferSameZone` as a new name for the old behaviour. The KEP also added a new value `PreferSameNode`, which indicates that traffic for a service should preferentially be routed to endpoints on the same node as the client. This KEP made traffic distribution less ambiguous and delivers traffic to a local endpoint when possible. If the local endpoint is unavailable, the traffic is routed to a remote endpoint.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
