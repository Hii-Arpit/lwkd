*LWKD has been on hiatus due to KubeConEU and multiple industry conferences.  As such, this issue covers the last two weeks of development.  Mind the gap?  LWKD is [looking for contributors](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io/issues/8)*

## Community Meeting Summary

The demo that kicked off [the community meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) was [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/), a simple-to-configure routing tool for Kubernetes built on [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), which can replace Ingress for some users.

[SIG-Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture), according to Brian Grant, is finalizing their [charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2074), as well as working with SIG-PM on the KEP process.  They also want to create a formal review process for API changes.  Interested?  Join their weekly [office hours](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md) to discuss things.  [SIG-Contributor Experience](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience) is thinking of launching a [contributor site](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-contributor-experience/0005-contributor-site.md), per Paris Pittman.  The first part of this is a [Discourse forum](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/), which was launched this week.  They are planning a contributor survey for June, have started the [Developers Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1919), and [need mentors](https://goo.gl/forms/3ISrNbTkYqExWzKw1) as always.

The big news of the week is that [Docs and website have moved to Hugo.io](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/05/05/hugo-migration/) from Jeckyll.  As Hugo has somewhat different and stricter formatting, Docs contributors may need to revise contributions.  SIG-Apps has posted [the results of the Applications survey](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/24/kubernetes-application-survey-results-2018/).  Lastly, [SIG-UI needs help](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-ui/README.md), esp. JS and go programmers.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: Beta0 Release, May 15th*

Last week was [week 6 of 12](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md) for 1.11 development.  The focus was on [fixing test failures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j2K8cxraSp8jZR2S-kJUT6GNjtXYU9hocNRiVUGZWvc/edit#gid=127492362).  Thanks to the hard work of the Release Team (especially Aish Sundar) and the responsiveness of contributors, we appear likely to be able to release Beta0 on time.  But please check your Github email for messages from CI Signal.

We have [42 Features](https://bit.ly/k8s111-features) in the tracking worksheet. There is a 1.10.3 update release planned for May 21st.

## Feature Work

* The kubelet config key in its ConfigMap must [now be explicitly named](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59847), instead of relying on magic naming.
* The OpenStack cloud provider [has been moved](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63524) to the external module. Other cloud providers will be moved in the future.
* Support [OpenID Connect distributed claims](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63213).
* [Reduce frequency of garbage collector calls](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63657) to reduce load on the APIserver.
* CRD Status now [supports GET and PATCH](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63619), and making a spec required [is straightened out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63533).
* Client-based restmappers have been [moved to client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63507) where they belong.
* `kubectl delete` based on selection criteria [no longer errors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63490) if no objects were found, a.nd `cp` [now supports command completion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60371).
* Add [`kubeadm list-images` command](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63450).
* Creating ConfigMaps and Secrets from files [now works on Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63439).
* Pod name and namespace is [now being carried through to stats collection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63406).
* The kubelet `--node-ip` flag now also [reports DNS info](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63170).
* KubeAdm now [searches for configs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62850) in standard locations.

## Deprecated

* The dynamic client for client-go [has been replaced](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63446), please switch to the new one.
* A preflight check that validated custom arguments [has been removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63673) from kubeadm to avoid dependency bloat.
* `master-count` endpoint type for APIserver is [deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63383) and will be removed in 1.13.

## Version Updates

* [go to 1.10.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63412)

* Support [Azure VMs with underscores](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63526).
* The deprecated `--allow-privileged` flag, removed from kubelet, is [now effectively true](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63442) in order to allow PodSecurityPolicy to work.
* [Stop blocking creation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63403) based on lack of deletion rights.
* [Re-enable nodeipam controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63049) for external clouds.

* Change shell scripts to [use `/usr/bin/env`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62657).

## Graph of the Week

![pie chart of GUI usage](/2018/images/ui_usage.png)

The results of the Application Survey included a number of charts.  The respondees skew heavily towards Helm users, so it's interesting to see what else Helm users use, such as which GUI they use, if any.  As you can see here, 40% of them don't use a GUI at all.
