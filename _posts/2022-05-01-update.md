## Developer News

The April [community meeting](https://bit.ly/k8scommunity) covered several ongoing efforts in the project:

We might see [Tech Leads separating from Chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5890) as it is hard to figure out between TL and chairs in some areas whose approval is needed or who's responsible for what. In some cases, this will mean the same person occupying both seats until they can recruit more. Relatedly, folks proposed adding [terms for chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5886). The proposal establishes 2 year term between reviews.

Paris reminded Leads about the [upcoming annual reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/238), and discussed potential improvements.

The longest discussion was about [not closing high priority bugs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/25967). Some serious bugs that are unresolved are being closed by the bot. Proposed: don't auto-close `priority/critical-urgent` or `priority/important*` issues with a `triage/accepted` label in kubernetes/kubernetes repository. 

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.24 Release, May 3rd**

1.24 is nearly here! [RC1 is available] for your testing pleasure, or you can just wait for the final release.

With that, the 1.25 team is [accepting Shadow applications](https://forms.gle/X9R3SjToUyb5BqAi9), so if you want to experience a release cycle close-up, give it a try.

The 1.25 release cycle starts on [May 23rd](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.25).

## Other Merges

Quite a number of fixes [have been cherry-picked]() back to 1.21, so expect a bugfix-full May patch release.
