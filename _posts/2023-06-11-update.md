## Developer News

Please [migrate your test jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/29722) off the old Prow Default Cluster as soon as you can, please.

The Kustomize Project is looking to [train new maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/M5OphEVsv5o); [apply](https://forms.gle/gHe89mtPT2aEzJra8) if you love Kustomize and you can spend some serious time on it.

The Kubernetes Contributor Summit Chicago is [looking for event volunteers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7354) to help run the Summit.  Note that you must be a Kubernetes contributor to be eligible.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Due, June 16th (01:00 UTC)**

Hopefully you [opted in your Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) for Production Readiness Review, so by this Thursday you'll have a completed, or at least in-progress, PRR.  If not, you're going to need to seek an Exception.

Patch releases, including a [go version bump](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/3099) are expected out this Wednesday.

## Featured PRs

### [#114394: Document versioning of CRI API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114394)

SIG-Node has added some documentation to `k/k` to clarify how CRI as a library and standard will be versioned over time, and how Kubernetes should interact with it. This solidifies the use of SemVer in a similar way as Kubernetes itself and a similar N-3 version skew compatibility rule. It also includes a changelog back through CRI v1 being introduced in Kubernetes 1.20. For both developers and CRI admins, this document is well worth a read to better understand the goals for how CRI will evolve over time.

### [#117793: use the cgroup aware OOM killer if available](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117793)

Support for cgroups v2 went GA back in 1.25 but one new feature we haven't previously made use of is the cgroup-aware OOM support added in kernel 4.19. In short, this mode means that if any task in a cgroup is selected for OOM termination, the whole group is terminated. This avoids common issues with things like forking web servers where a subprocess inside the container OOMs but Kubernetes is unaware of this because PID 1 keeps running. Some tools handle this internally but most don't and either blindly retry the failing operation or, in the worst cases, corrupt some internal state.
