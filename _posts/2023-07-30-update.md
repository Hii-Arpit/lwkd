## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Themes and Docs Complete, August 8**

Hopefully all your features are debugged and you're hard at work on revising documentation, because those docs need to be edited and finished in a week. Then on to the release!  As always during code freeze, please watch for and respond promptly to any test failures.

This Friday is also the deadline for cherry-picks for the next round of patch releases.
