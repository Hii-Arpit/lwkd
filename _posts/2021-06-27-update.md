## Developer News

The [Community Annual Report](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/06/28/announcing-kubernetes-community-group-annual-reports/) is out.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, July 8th**

Code Freeze is staring [in a little over a week](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/UJDpGmOQTcA), which means it's time to merge those enhancements or punt them to 1.23.  Also, don't forget that Docs wants your placeholder PRs on July 9th. There's just [one open critical-urgent bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100914) in 1.22 right now, so if you know the code, maybe help close it?

Cherry-picks for the next patch release are due July 12th.

## Featured PR

### [#103099: PodSecurity admission](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103099)

While PodSecurityPolicies are being deprecated, there is both demand and desire to provide some level of protection in Kubernetes itself for common use cases and patterns. So we have the new Pod Security system as a very partial replacement. The goal here is to start small so if your use case isn't exactly covered, you can keep using an out-of-tree validation webhook or use a webhook and this together. I can't cover the full cross-section of this new system so if you are interested in trying it, please do check out [the KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2579-psp-replacement). But a basic summary:

There are three security profiles:
* `privileged`: Unconstrained, do anything just like you could without this system.
* `baseline`: Known obvious container escapes are closed off but otherwise normal system access.
* `restricted`: Follows Kubernetes hardening best-practices.

Unlike PSPs, these policies are baked in and cannot be changed by users, though they are versioned so updates can be released along Kubernetes itself. What these mean in concrete terms is each policy has [a set of Pod fields and the values permitted for them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#policies). If you want to start experimenting with these now [there are equivalent PSPs provided](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#policy-instantiation).

You configure which policies to use where based on labels on the Namespace object. Once configured, the policy will apply to all Pods (and PodTemplate-containing objects in core) in that Namespace. On each Namespace, there are three policy actions that can be configured:

* `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: <policy name>` - Any Pod that doesn't match the requested policy will be rejected by kube-apiserver. This will not affect already-running Pods or objects containing a PodTemplate like a Deployment.
* `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: <policy name>` - Any Pod or PodTemplate-y object that doesn't match the requested policy will trigger an annotation on the audit events for the API call. This can be combined with an audit webhook to provide any behavior you want (realtime alerts, logging, etc).
* `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: <policy name>` - Any Pod or PodTemplate-y object that doesn't match the requested policy will send back warning headers in the API server response which some clients (including `kubectl`) will display to the user.

You can (and probably will) use multiple of these at once to get the desired response behavior. You can also specify a `...-version` label for each of the three actions which controls the version of the policy to use. Versions follow Kubernetes' own versioning, with a default of `latest` which gives you the most current version of the policy.

tl;dr three pre-set security policies, configured using Namespace labels, enforce vs. log vs warn configured per Namespace.

## Other Merges

* kube-apiserver [supports distributed tracing](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94942)

* `k8s.io/component-base/logs` [is reverting registering JSON logging format by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102869), since JSON logging is not yet GA; this will involve multiple PRs and may break some tests
* CRI [supports more cgroups v2 features](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102578), such as memory QOS
* The scheduler will preference [only putting pods that need a scarce HW resource](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103169) on nodes that have it
* API Priority and Fairness [gets some success metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102859)
* Don't revert previously Running containers to Pending status [if the kubelet doesn't know their state](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102821)
* [Fix syncing mounter selection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103154) by CSI drivers with SELinux volume labeling
* Straighten out [some weird cases in upgrading DualStack services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102898)
* CSI nodeIDs can be [256 characters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101256)
* Documentation for the new [typed Apply system](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102540)
* Continue [switching back to stdlib errors package](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103079)

## Promotions

* [CSIServiceAccountToken to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103001)
* [kubectl command headers are beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103238) and on by default; time to start writing debugging tools to take advantage of them
* [ServiceLoadBalancerClass to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103129)
* [SuspendJob to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102022)
* [kubelet memory manager to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101947) and on by default, and [extend pod resource API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101030) to support it

## Cleanups

* [Remove ServiceAppProtocol feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103190) since it went GA in 1.20
* [Remove RunAsGroup feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101581) since it's been GA for two releases
* [Remove BalancedAttachNodeVolumes from the scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102443), since it was only actually used by OpenShift, which doesn't need it anymore

## Version Updates

* [Debian to 1.8.0, iptables to 1.6.5, and setcap to 2.0.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103235) in official images
* [CoreDNS to 1.8.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102466) in kubeadm
