## Developer News

The [Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2024) has begun!  Now is the time to decide if you should be on Steering.  If so, [nominate yourself](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2024#candidacy-process).  Also, it's time to [check if you're eligible to vote](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/z7wmuHO-2N8), since there's plenty of time to fix that if the system doesn't have you yet.

The Job Migration deadline is past and [umigrated jobs are being removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/33226).  The Infra team plans to migrate Prow around August 21st (after the 1.31 release), during which there will be a Prow outage.  Infra recommends that Kubernetes subprojects not make any releases at the end of August.

The GitHub Admins are [migrating all of our GitHub Orgs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/59Huu9dbqXQ) to be under a single Enterprise account.  This is not expected to be disruptive, but they'll do it one org at a time just in case.

SIG Node [nominates Peter Hunt](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/fbo7LTaRs-A) to be the third chair of the SIG.
