## KEP of the Week

[KEP 4800: Split UncoreCache Topology Awareness in CPU Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4800-cpumanager-split-uncorecache/README.md)

This KEP introduced a new static policy `prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache` for the CPU Manager that groups CPU resources by uncore cache where possible. An uncore cache refers to the cache that exists at a shared level among CPU cores. This is primarily beneficial for CPU architectures that utilize multiple uncore caches, or split uncore caches, within the processor.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
