## Developer News

Now that [Pod Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) is a thing, E2E tests [will be run under the restricted pod security level](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106454).  If this breaks your tests, you may need to [request a different level](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md#pod-security-admission).

You also might need to [rebase to master](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/8x3KZEGxTx0) to pick up changes introduced for golang 1.18.

Etcd [needs more reviewers/maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/steering/c/e-O-tVSCJOk).  If you have experience with the Etcd code, but have moved on to other things, consider coming back to help out the project.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, March 29th/30th**

[Code Freeze is coming](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/U1mzQqSVIQM). You should have everything approved/LGTMed by tomorrow (6pm Pacific/1am UTC), or punt it to 1.25. [Exceptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) are possible, but are not always granted.

[Master Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) is definitely better than last week, with just four flaky jobs -- kudos to Jordan Liggit and Eddie Zane for [diagnosing the skew test failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108307).

## Featured PRs

### [#99556: kubectl: support --subresource flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99556)

The `get`, `patch`, `edit`, and `replace` Kubectl commands are all getting a `--subresource` flag to access things like `/scale` and `/status`. The latter especially is very helpful to operator developers who need to manually adjust a broken status value and previously had to use `--raw` mode.

### [#108073: Support CEL CRD validation expressions that reference existing object state.](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108073)

Continuing the train of awesome CEL features, this week's is the ability to use `oldSelf` in Update validations to allow checking values on both the old and new data. As a simple example, checking `oldSelf == self` on a field allows for replicating partial immutability like we have in man core types. This opens up many options for out-of-core development!

### [#108717: Remove ClusterName](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108717)

ObjectMeta has long had an unused `ClusterName` field. This was added long ago for some federation experiments and never cleaned up. Despite existing forever, it has been unwritable and thus always `""` for the whole time. To move things forward on getting rid of it, the Go struct member (but not the JSON field name) has been change. This will make anything using that field fail to compile. If you find any such code and it actually depends on this field somehow, please contact SIG-APIMachinery as soon as possible.
