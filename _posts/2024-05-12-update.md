## Developer News

The Azure File CSI Driver is affected by [CVE-2024-3744](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/124759); please upgrade ASAP.

The Kubernetes documentation is now available in 16 different languages. Thanks to every community member who helped on the translation and launch of the
new [Bengali website](https://kubernetes.io/bn/).

The planning for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit NA 2024 has started and the organizer team is [looking for shadows and volunteers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7854#issuecomment-2109208587). Some roles do not require being at the KCS in person.

Do you use etcd clusters in addition to the one embedded in Kubernetes?  If so, SIG-Etcd and SIG-Cluster-Lifecycle want to hear from you about [a potential new etcd operator](https://forms.gle/rfrKVgxHx9Wgy9fz8).

SIG Cloud Provider The new WG-Serving has [published their workstream](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hbEx3ZEqdXCqWH9RL3uy9FIy35B8pFJ5KiK3HsOz2FE/edit).
