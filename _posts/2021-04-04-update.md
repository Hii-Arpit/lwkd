## Developer News

Short issue for you this week because folks are heads-down with finishing the 1.21 release.

Kubernetes Prow is [shifting to being deployed continuously](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-testing/2539-continuously-deploy-k8s-prow), where "continuously" means "every 6 hours".  Main benefit is saving the Infra team a lot of manual work.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.21 Release, April 8**

We are in the final test-fixing countdown to the release.  Release notes were completed Monday, and 1.21 is still on schedule to go out on Thursday.  That means if you do get a message from the Release Team about a failing test or bug, please give it immediate attention.

Speaking of the RT, [shadow applications are now open for the 1.22 team](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/mW7p7KMSzr4).  If you have dreamed of being a Kubernetes Release Team member, now's your chance.

Cherry-picks for the next round of [patch releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/patch-releases.md) are due this Friday.

In lieu of a PR this (quiet) week, a blog post! Our newest PSC member has written up an excellent summary of the history and future of the long-suffering PodSecurityPolicy system. Its deprecation in 1.21 may still catch many users unawares so keep this handy for folks that haven't been keeping up with the news week-by-week.
