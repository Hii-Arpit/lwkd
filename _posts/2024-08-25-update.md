## Developer News


[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-ai-dev-china/) happened last week in Hong Kong. The event had various talks on AI, running AI workloads on Kubernetes and the CNCF ecosystem, and updates from various maintainers of different CNCF projects. There was also a keynote by Linus Torvalds. Videos will be posted in the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cncf) soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.32 cycle begins, September 9**

We're in the period between releases. Shadow applications for the [v1.32 release team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb60FW9aYIepSdXIWexQIKNJ8m3JSqHZ6kkH3Q_I7XP9OVYA/viewform) are open until September 6. The tentative dates for the v1.32 cycle are from September 9th to December 11th, 2024.

## Featured PRs

### [#126745: Improve PVC protection controller's scalability by batch-processing PVCs by namespace & caching live pod list results [fixed dead loop issue with idle work queue]](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126745)

This PR significantly enhances the scalability of the PVC Protection Controller by implementing batch processing of PVCs by namespace and caching live pod list results. It resolves a critical dead loop issue in the idle work queue and addresses performance bottlenecks in large clusters by reducing the number of API calls required for PVC deletion. As a result, the kube-controller-manager's CPU usage is optimized, ensuring more efficient and reliable operation, especially in environments with high pod and PVC churn.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3998: Job success/completion policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3998-job-success-completion-policy)

This (KEP) aims to enhance Indexed Jobs by allowing custom success criteria, so a job can be marked as succeeded based on specific pod indexes, such as leader pods, rather than requiring all pods to succeed. It supports distributed computing frameworks like MPI and PyTorch, where only certain pods determine job success. The proposal does not alter the default behavior for jobs without a SuccessPolicy or extend this feature to `NonIndexed` Jobs in its first iteration.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in v1.31.
