## Developer News

[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-ai-dev-china/) happened last week in Hong Kong. The event spanned for 3 days, from 21st-23rd August, and had various talks on AI, running AI workloads on Kubernetes and the CNCF ecosystem, and updates from various maintainers of different CNCF projects. There was also a keynote by Linus Torvalds on the last day of the event. The videos of the talks will be posted in the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cncf) soon.

## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 3998: Job success/completion policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3998-job-success-completion-policy)

This (KEP) aims to enhance Indexed Jobs by allowing custom success criteria, so a job can be marked as succeeded based on specific pod indexes, such as leader pods, rather than requiring all pods to succeed. This is designed to support distributed computing frameworks like MPI and PyTorch, where only certain pods determine job success. The proposal does not alter the default behaviour for jobs without a SuccessPolicy or extend this feature to `NonIndexed` Jobs in its first iteration.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in v1.31.
