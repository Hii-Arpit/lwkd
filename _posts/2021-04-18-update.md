## Developer News

The Kubernetes [release schedule is changing](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/IxnWeVRIadM), to 3 releases a year, starting with this year.  Per the [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2567)
 and [SIG-Release Meeting](https://bit.ly/k8s-sig-release-meeting), we will be releasing new versions of Kubernetes on the following *tentative* schedule:

* 1.22: August 2, 2021
* 1.23: December 14, 2021
* 1.24: April 12, 2022
* 1.25: August 22, 2022
* 1.26: December 6, 2022

Moving to 3 releases a year is expected to make things easier on the SIGs and the release teams.  If it doesn't, we'll revert back to quarterly releases in 2023.

Rogerio Bastos & Ari Lima discovered [CVE-2021-25735](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/ES_850GbJ1U), a security hole that allows bypassing some Admission Webhooks, now fixed in the latest update releases.

The Slack team has [deployed an "inclusive language" Slack Bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5660), which is just there to remind you not to use exclusive language like "guys".  This is a bit of an experiment, so we'll see how it goes.

SIG-CLI plans to [overhaul kubectl exit codes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2574) and would like your feedback.  Will this break your scripts, or fix them?

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.22 Release Cycle Begins this week**

The 1.22 Release Team has been chosen, and work on the release will start this week.  Expect calls for enhancements soon.

[1.20.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.19.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md), and [1.18.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md) are available.  Among other things, these fix CVE-2021-25735, so install real soon if you use Admission Webhooks.

## Featured PRs

### [#101155: allow multiple of --service-account-issuer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101155)

As part of the continued push towards a customizable service account JWT system, there is now a migration path towards changing the issuer field. While only the first configured issuer will be used for creating new JWTs, any of them will be accepted as valid when checking existing tokens. This allows for a smooth migration onto a non-default issuer string without downtime for pod tokens. If you haven't checked out the [token volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection) system, or have been putting off playing with it due to the complexities of the rollout, this may help and thus will unlock a powerful set of tools for pod identity validation.

### [#99237: Use the audit ID of a request for better correlation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99237)

Distributed tracing fans rejoice! Kube-APIServer will now make better use of the existing "audit ID" concept to be more like a span ID for tracing purposes. This allows for better correlation between tracing tools, error/access logs, and aggregated API requests. If you have existing log parsing for error analysis, probably add this field once it's available for you.

### [#101151: Add "node-high" priority-level](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101151)

This new `node-high` API priority level has been added to the standard configuration to ensure that even during an overload situation, kubelet status updates and heartbeats will (probably) get processed. This avoids some terrible priority inversion situation where an overload from too many pods starting up never ends as they keep getting rescheduled off "failed" nodes. If you have a customized API fairness configuration, check out this new addition and consider adding something equivalent to your infrastructure.

### [#101048: Revert Revert](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101048)

Promotion of the MemoryBackedVolumeSizing feature to beta (for setting quotas on EmptyDir) was [reverted and taken out of 1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/0e70b6a25130c8706d63399455a8cd1139a26bd1).  The feature promotion has been added back to 1.22; hopefully it passes tests this time.
