## Developer News

Kubernetes turns 10 this week! The [KuberTENes Birthday Bash](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kuber10es-birthday-bash/) is happening on 6th June all across the world. Attend [an event next to you](https://www.cncf.io/kubertenes/) to join in on the celebrations.

Carlos Santana started a Google document to [collect KuberTENes trivia and timeline information](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/AmAbg-V2bv4). Help contribute to the doc or feel free to use it for organizing a KuberTENes party where you live!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, June 6th, 2024**

We're approaching the enhancements freeze deadline, with only two more weeks left. We have a total of [49 KEPs opted-in](https://bit.ly/k8s131-enhancements) for the v1.31 release as of now. Don't forget to talk to your SIG leads to get a lead-opted-in label if you're planning to get your KEP shipped in v1.31. The production readiness freeze is coming up on 6th, one week before the enhancements freeze. Make sure that your KEP has a completed PRR questionnaire before the 6th to ensure enough time for the PRR team to review all the KEPs.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4580: Deprecate and remove Kubelet RunOnce mode](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4580)

This KEP proposes to deprecate and remove kubelet's RunOnce mode. RunOnce mode does not support any of the newer Pod features like init containers and the Pod lifecycle for RunOnce mode is not well defined. Podman addresses the same use case in a more well-supported way. RunOnce mode also doesn't work when the kubelet is running in systemd mode.

This was [first brought up way back in 2017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47184), and is finally [on track](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/124030) to being deprecated in v1.31.
