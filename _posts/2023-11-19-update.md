## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Themes and Docs Complete, November 28**

Hopefully, you've debugged all of your features and are hard at work editing documentation, because those docs need to be edited and done in a week. Then on to the release! Please keep an eye out for and respond to any test failures during code freeze, as always.

Patch releases [1.28.4](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/k5HaLtE8jnM), [1.27.8](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/GLQ2R0e9OaE), [1.26.11](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/iHSD1DMNjd8) and [1.25.16](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/CNZH-8Cn_n8) came out last week. This includes golang updates.
