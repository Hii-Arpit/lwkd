## Community Meeting Summary

This week's demo was [Stork](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork), a tool for managing "hyperconverged" storage in Kubernetes.  The [community meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY) then continued with release updates, the graph, and some SIG updates.  [Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture) is working on implementing the subproject proposal explained in [last week's issue](/2018/20180205).  Bob Wise of [Scalability](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability) did [a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QunsQVGe4Ky570dI3hwBPH-BdD65wHkMz-g0S_fPYww/edit#slide=id.p) where he explained that the SIG will be focusing just on preventing scalability regressions, and has no concrete plans to push Kubernetes clusters beyond 5000 nodes in size.  If you want bigger clusters, contribute to the SIG. They also have [a new charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1607).  [Scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling) is promoting priority and preemption to Beta status, optimizing Affinity, and designing a new extension model for the scheduler.  They also mentioned three "incubator" projects, [Kube-arbitrator](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-arbitrator), [Cluster capacity tool](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cluster-capacity), and [Descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/descheduler).

[Brendan Burns](https://github.com/brendandburns) went over [some of the changes to repos](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1752) outlined in the [last issue](/2018/20180205).  The project is continuing Meet Our Contributors sessions the first Wednesday of every month, and [needs volunteers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1753).

## Release Schedule

We are now in week 7 of the 1.10 release cycle.  Feature freeze has passed, file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/blob/master/EXCEPTIONS.md) if you missed the deadline.  This week, we will be cutting the first Beta release and creating the Release branch.

The next deadline is Code Slush on February 20th.  The release lead warns contributors that the [schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md) will be enforced.

## Feature Work

* The Local Volumes Plugin now has [block volume support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59303).
* CRI now [uses the mountpoint as a storage identifier](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59475).  This may cause some backwards-compatibility issues, especially for devicemapper.  CRI has also made backwards-incompatible [changes to support shared PID namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58973).
* [Auditing is enabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59067) behind a feature gate.
* All workloads (Deployment, ReplicaSet, etc.) are now [stored in etcd in apps/v1 format](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58854).
* [PersistentVolumes have more measurements](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57872) now.
* Custom resources now support [prometheus metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57682).
* [Context data is now present](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59287) for all relevant cloud APIs. as part of a general [effort to carry context all through Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/815).
* Added a [generic cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59520) for loadbalancer data on Azure, and [auto-deletion of abandoned IP addresses](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59340).
* [Key Management Service plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55684) now speak gRPC.
* [MountPropagation is now Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59252).
* The [certificate controller can delete CSRs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59375) for cleanup purposes.
* There are now [volume metrics on vSphere](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59328).
* [KubeAdm added an imagePullPolicy option to init config](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58960) and an option to [not taint the master](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55479).
* Ceph volumes can now use a [keyring parameter](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58287).
* [AWS attach/detach is faster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56974).

## Deprecated

* The [KubeletConfiguration.ConfigTrialDuration config field](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59628) has been removed.
* You can't [name PriorityClasses starting with "system-" anymore](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59382).
* The [--service-sync-period flag has been removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59359) from the controller-manager.
* [persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy of "Recycle"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59060) is being deprecated.

## Version Updates

* Calico to [Version 2.6.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59130).

## Other Merges

* All Kubernetes project containers can now be [pulled from k8s.gcr.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57824).
* Kubelet is [only registering API sources when connecting](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59276), allowing standalone Kubelets to stop hanging forever.
* The scheduler now [only uses the default predicate/prioritizer if they are unspecified](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59363) in the policy config, retroactive to 1.9.
* "none" is now an option for [EnforceNodeAllocatable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59515).
* The [scheduler can take a config file without a ConfigMap](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59386) now.
* [Pod priority will be silently ignored if disabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59291).
* Windows nodes have [more accurate memory reporting](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57124).

## Graph of the Week

![issue tracking graph](/2018/images/issue_tracking.png)

This week's graph, per [Tim Pepper](https://github.com/tpepper), is [feature activity on issues](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/000000031/sig-issues?orgId=1&from=now-1y&to=now&var-period=d7&var-sig=All&var-kind=feature).  You can track feature activity here through the release cycle, including how feature activity is "back-loaded", where most happens near each deadline (Feature Freeze, Code Freeze, Release).
