## Featured PRs

### [128718 FG:InPlacePodVerticalScaling- Enable resizing containers without limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128718)

This PR fixes critical bugs in the pod resize code, specifically addressing cases where containers lack resource limits.
It ensures proper handling of these scenarios, enabling in-place vertical scaling for such containers. Also,
the PR enhances test coverage to prevent regressions, marking a step forward for reliable container resizing in Kubernetes.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP-3221: Structured Authorization Configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3221)

Currently, kube-apiserver configures its authorization chain using `--authorization-*` flags, limiting admins to a single webhook via `--authorization-modes`. This restricts creating ordered authorization chains with multiple webhooks. This proposal suggests a structured configuration for defining the authorization chain, supporting multiple webhooks with fine-grained controls, including an explicit Deny authorizer.

This KEP is tracked for alpha release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
