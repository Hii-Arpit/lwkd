## Developer News

You have one day (or less) left to [vote for Steering Committee members](https://git.k8s.io/community/elections/steering/2024#readme).

The [call for presentations](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/program/maintainer-summit/#call-for-proposals) for the [Maintainer Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/program/maintainer-summit/) in Kubecon India is now open.  The Maintainer summit combines a Kubernetes Contributor Summit with contributor discussions and presentations by other CNCF projects.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness, October 3**

It's the [second week of 1.32](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.32) and hopefully you're hard at work on your planned [Enhancements](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/195/views/1).

## KEP of the Week

#### [KEP 2837: Pod level resource limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837)

Currently resource allocation in PodSpec is done at the container level. The scheduler aggregates the resources requested by all the containers to find a suitable Node for the Pod. The Pod API lacks a way to specify limits at the Pod level, limiting the flexibility and ease of resource management for Pods as a whole. This KEP extends the Pod API with a resource spec at the Pod level. This new feature can be used to complement the existing resource limits and make things easier for tightly coupled applications. The KEP explains how the resource limits will be applied in different cases when Pod level and container level requests and limits are specified, as well as how the OOM score calculation will be done.

This KEP is tracked for alpha stage in the upcoming v1.32 release.
