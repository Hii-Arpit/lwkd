#### [KEP 2837: Pod level resource limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837)

Currently resource allocation in PodSpec is done at the container level. Users can set resource requests and limits for each container and the scheduler takes the aggregate of the resources requested by all the containers to find a suitable Node to schedule the Pod. The Pod API lacks a way to specify limits at the Pod level, limiting the flexibility and ease of resource management for Pods as a whole. This KEP proposes to extend the Pod API to allow specifying a resource spec at the Pod level. This new feature can be used to complement the existing resource limits at the container level and make things easier for tightly coupled applications. The KEP goes into the details of how the resource limits will be applied in different cases when Pod level and container level requests and limits are specified. It also talks about various changes to how the OOM score calculation would be done.

This KEP is tracked for alpha stage in the upcoming v1.32 release.
