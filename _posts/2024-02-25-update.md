## Developer News

There's an updated [Kubernetes v1.30 State of the Release and Important Deadlines](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-release/c/5aTnA01W4HY)

Contributor Summit Paris [schedule is live](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcseu/schedule/#schedule).  If you have a new topic, time to [suggest an unconference item](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7692).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: CODE Freeze Begins, March 5th**

Kubernetes [v1.30.0-alpha.3](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/KGo9_MISVas) is live!

The Code Freeze milestone for the Kubernetes 1.30 release cycle is approaching rapidly. Have all your necessary changes been submitted? Following this, there's the usual release countdown: submit documentation PRs by February 26th, publish deprecation blog on Thursday, and conclude testing freeze and documentation finalization next week. Once we enter Code Freeze, please promptly address any test failures. Questions can be answered on #SIG-release.

## Featured PRs

### [ #122589: promote contextual logging to beta, enabled by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122589)

Adding [contextual logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging) to Kubernetes has been a long, long road.  Removing the tree-wide dependency on klog required refactoring code all over Kubernetes, which took the time of hundreds of contributors.  This PR enables contextual logging by default since many components and clients now support it.

### [ #123157: Add SELinuxMount feature gate ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123157)

Use this one neat SELinux trick for faster relabeling of volumes! Users with `SELinux=enforcing` currently suffer latency due to needing to relabel all content on volume so that pods can access it. SELinuxMount instead mounts the volume using `-o context=XYZ` which skips the recursive walk. Currently alpha; needs tests, disabled by default.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-4176: A new static policy to prefer allocating cores from different CPUs on the same socket](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4176-cpumanager-spread-cpus-preferred-policy/README.md)

This KEP proposes a new CPU Manager Static Policy Option called `distribute-cpus-across-cores` to prefer allocating CPUs from different physical cores on the same socket. This will be similar to the `distribute-cpus-across-numa` policy option, but it proposes to spread CPU allocations instead of packing them together. Such a policy is useful if an application wants to avoid being a noisy neighbor with itself, but still want to take advantage of the L2 cache.
