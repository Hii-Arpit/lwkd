Kubernetes [v1.30.0-alpha.3](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/KGo9_MISVas) is live!

The Code Freeze milestone for the Kubernetes 1.30 release cycle is approaching rapidly. Have all your necessary changes been submitted? Following this, there's the usual release countdown: submit documentation PRs by February 26th, publish deprecation blog on Thursday, and conclude testing freeze and documentation finalization next week.

## Featured PRs

### [ #122589: promote contextual logging to beta, enabled by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122589)

Adding [contextual logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging) to Kubernetes has been a long, long road.  Removing the tree-wide dependency on klog required refactoring code all over Kubernetes, which took the time of hundreds of contributors.  This PR enables contextual logging by default since many components and clients now support it.

### [ #123157: Add SELinuxMount feature gate ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123157)

Use this one neat SELinux trick for faster relabeling of volumes! Users with `SELinux=enforcing` currently suffer latency due to needing to relabel all content on volume so that pods can access it. SELinuxMount instead mounts the volume using `-o context=XYZ` which skips the recursive walk. Currently alpha; needs tests, disabled by default.
