CNCF's Mentoring team is looking for Google Summer of Code mentorship tasks for GSOC 2025.  If your SIG has mentors and wants to participate, please [submit a PR to the 2025 plan](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/programs/summerofcode/2025.md).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Placeholder PRs for Docs, February 27**

Enhancements freeze was last week and we have a total of 76 KEPs tracked for v1.33 after the freeze! Out of these, 30 are KEPs in alpha, 22 graduating to beta, 22 graduating to GA and 2 are deprecation/removal KEPs.

The next deadline is the Docs placeholder PRs deadline, which is on February 27th. If you have your KEP(s) tracked for the release, follow the steps [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/#open-a-placeholder-pr) to open a placeholder PR against the `dev-1.33` branch in the k/website repo soon.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 3257: Cluster Trust Bundles](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3257-cluster-trust-bundles)

This KEP introduces `ClusterTrustBundle`, a cluster-scoped resource for certificate signers to share trust anchors with workloads, along with a `clusterTrustBundle` kubelet projected volume source for filesystem-based access. A default `ClusterTrustBundle` with the `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-serving` signer is also introduced, potentially replacing the current `kube-root-ca.crt` ConfigMaps.
