## Developer News

Tentative plans for the Contributor Summit around KubeCon in October include an on-site unconference-type event before KubeCon, and an online Contributor Celebration event after KubeCon. However, this is all very dependent on what the travel situation in October actually looks like.

Jim Bugwadia and Robert Ficcaglia have been [nominated as the new chairs of WG Policy](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/rsYcJQfGHV4)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exception Requests Due, June 28**

We're in the "write some code" portion of the release cycle.  And while you're writing some code, why not [write a feature blog or release theme too](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/g8pm9bg1-Lo)?

It's also time to Fix Your Test Jobs.  We have a total of [7 jobs not passing in Master-Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) and [13 jobs not passing in Informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing), which include test fails and flakes from [almost every SIG](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/lpAsAFaBkj4).  So please get on diagnosing and fixing your team's fails/flakes, before this grinds 1.22 dev and patch release work to a halt.

Next patch releases are June 16th, provided that tests are passing by then.

## Featured PRs

### [#101688: Add field-level warning plumbing and add pod spec warnings](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101688)

For a few releases we've had the warnings headers as a way to send back non-fatal messages to be shown by the API client (kubectl, etc) to notify users of upcoming removals or behavior changes. Now that's been extended deep into the apiserver plumbing, so any type can declare a warnings check hook for incoming object data and emit per-field warnings to be sent back to the user. If you own any API types, consider implementing these new `WarningsOnCreate` and `WarningsOnUpdate` hooks in your strategy file for an improved user experience with deprecations.

### [#100136: Add feature gate to disable all in-tree cloud providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100136)

Another step towards removing in-tree cloud controllers, they can now be disabled entirely via a `DisableCloudProviders` feature gate. It was previously possible to disable these independently in each place that touches cloud-y things but now we have a centralized toggle. Moving cloud code out of the main tree is still going to be a slow process but one step easier and one step closer than before. If you've already migrated to an out-of-tree provider, you can enable this as a second line of defense for the in-tree provider accidentally reactivating.
