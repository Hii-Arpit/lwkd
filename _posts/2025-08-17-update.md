## Developer News

A medium-severity vulnerability ([CVE-2025-5187, CVSS 6.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/133471)) affects Kubernetes clusters using the NodeRestriction admission controller without OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement. It allows a compromised node to delete its own Node object by patching OwnerReferences, then recreate it with altered taints or labels, bypassing normal delete restrictions.  Update to the latest patch release (1.33.4, 1.32.8, or 1.31.12) to close this security hole.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release day, 27 August**

We are in the final week before releasing 1.34.  Make sure to respond quickly to any blocker issues or test failures your SIG is tagged on.

Patch releases [1.33.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md), [1.32.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md), and [1.31.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md) were published this week, built with Go 1.24.5 and 1.23.11 respectively.  These patch releases primarily addresses an [exploitable security hole](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/133471) so admins should update at the next availble downtime. Kubernetes 1.31 enters maintenance mode on Aug 28, 2025; the End of Life date for Kubernetes 1.31 is Oct 28, 2025.

## Featured PRs

[133409: Make podcertificaterequestcleaner role feature-gated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133409)

This PR restricts the creation of RBAC permissions for the `podcertificaterequestcleaner` controller behind a feature gate. The `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` for this controller are now only created when the related feature is enabled; This change helps reduce unnecessary permissions in clusters where the controller is not in use; It supports a more secure and minimal RBAC configuration by avoiding unused roles.


## KEP of the Week

[KEP 2340: Consistent Reads from Cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/2340-Consistent-reads-from-cache/README.md)

This KEP introduces a mechanism to serve most reads from the watch cache while maintaining the same consistency guarantees as serving reads from etcd. Previously, the `Get` and `List` requests were guaranteed to be Consistent reads and were served from etcd using a "quorum read". Serving reads from the watch cache is more performant and scalable than reading them from etcd, deserializing them, applying selectors, converting them to the desired version, and then garbage collecting all the objects that were allocated during the whole process.

This KEP is tracked for Stable in 1.34
