KEP 2340: Consistent Reads from Cache

This KEP introduces a mechanism to serve most reads from the watch cache while maintaining the same consistency guarantees as serving reads from etcd. Previously, the `Get` and `List` requests were guaranteed to be Consistent reads and were served from etcd using a "quorum read". Serving reads from the watch cache is more performant and scalable than reading them from etcd, deserializing them, applying selectors, converting them to the desired version, and then garbage collecting all the objects that were allocated during the whole process.

This KEP is tracked for Stable in 1.34
