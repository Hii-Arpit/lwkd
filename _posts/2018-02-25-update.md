## Community Meeting Summary

Low attendance due to overlap with the [Helm Summit]() and the [Index Conf]() made for a very short [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#).  Aside from updates on the 1.10 release and the graph, it was entirely announcements:

* There will be a [Contributor Summit in Copenhagen on May 1](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/2018/05-contributor-summit).  This year, it will include a New Contributor track.
* Volunteers are needed for [User Office Hours](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md).
* Contributors wanted for [Meet Our Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) on March 7th.

## Release Schedule

Last week was [week 8 of 12 for 1.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md).  This week was "Code Slush", where SIGs are supposed to revise and filter PRs and Issues to make a final determination on which will be in 1.10.  Code Freeze was scheduled for 6pm Monday, Feb. 26th, but got postponed to 6pm Tuesday (today) because of infrastructure issues with the merge pipeline.  If you need an Exception to Code Freeze, contact [Jaice DuMars](mailto:jdumars@gmail.com) or [SIG-Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/).

## Feature Work

* [CSI](https://blog.kubernetes.io/2018/01/introducing-container-storage-interface.html) is completing its spec, with [mount/unmount commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60115), and [credential and secret handling support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60118) for storage that requires authentication.
* CRI now has [CPU and memory stats](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60328) in its Summary API, and [container log rotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59898).
* The [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler now supports external metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60096).
* Added [ShareProcessNamespace as a setting](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60181) for Pod specs.
* [kubectl now has a "create job" command for CronJobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60084), and has an [env command](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60040) to filter which keys come from a ConfigMap.
* We now have a [buffered backend for audit events](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60076); performance testing needed!
* The APIserver has a [--http2-max-streams-per-connection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60054) setting.
* You can [now get a count of objects](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59757) from the APIserver.
* CRDs now have [SubResources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55168), and [support categories in the CLI](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59561).
* [Kubeadm added an --apiserver-advertise-dns-address flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59288), and has changed [how it handles certs during etcd bootstrapping](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57415).
* [StorageOS directories are now configurable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58816).


Promoted to Beta:

* [DevicePlugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60170).
* [Configurable resolv.conf](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59771).
* [PVC Protection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59052).

## Deprecated

* ["--show-all" switch for kubectl will be deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60210) in 1.10, with removal in 1.11, since the switch never worked consistently and confused users.
* The [scale command for jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60139) has been removed.
* [Root /proxy paths](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59884), deprecated since 1.2, have been removed.
* The [word "manifest" has been expunged](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60314) from the Kubelet API.
* IPTables cleanup, including [running connection-rejecting rules less often](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60306), [eliminating no-op rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57461), and [splitting up the KUBE SERVICES chain](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56164).
* [Mount propagation for Windows containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60275) is now disabled.
* [StorageProtection has been renamed to StorageObjectInUseProtection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59901), because we love those long parameter names.

## Version Updates

* [cAdvisor godeps to 0.29.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60106).
* [oidc authentication to coreos/go-oidc v2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58544).
* [Dashboard to 1.8.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57326).

## Other Merges

* We are adding [spell-checking to commits](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59463) in order to cut down on the follow-up typo-fixing PRs.
* Our [Conformance Tests](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance), which protect API consistency, have been expanded this week with [StatefulSet tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60336) and [Garbage Collector tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60116).
* [Character devices are now recognized](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60440) as storage by the Kubelet.
* Fixed [ClusterID error](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60125), allowing Kubernetes to work on AWS spot instances.
* [Predicate key names are now consts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59952) in handlers, so update your code accordingly.
* [MemorySwap is now set to disabled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59404) for Docker/Linux nodes.
* All pods using "critical" PriorityClass names [will now be critical](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58835).
* We now have [default enabled Admission Controllers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58684), which may change cluster behavior for some users.

## Graph of the Week

![new contributors graph](/2018/images/new_contributors.png)

This week's graph is a new addition to DevStats, explained by [Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus).  The ability to attract new and part-time contributors is often cited as a measure of the health and continued growth of an OSS project, so Josh worked with [Lukasz]() to add this graph to track those contributors.  In this graph, New Contributors have never done a PR before, and Episodic contributors are ones who make between 1 and 6 PRs per year.  Kubernetes is seeing healthy growth for both stats, reassuring us that the additional process we've added for review and merge isn't hurting contributor growth (the spike on 2017-07-31 is a data artifact, and will be soon fixed).
