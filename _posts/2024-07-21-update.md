## Developer News

[CVE-2024-5321](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126161) allows unauthorized users on Windows to read container logs. Fixed in the latest patch releases.

You have one week to migrate the [remaining jobs on the old cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/docs/job-migration-todo.md) before they get deactivated. Notable bundles of unmigrated jobs belong to SIG-Storage (CSI driver tests), SIG-Cloud Provider (Azure), and the ClusterAPI subproject.

Test-Infra is eliminating last bits of Google-owned notification systems in favor of community-owned ones.  This means you should use community Slack channels ``#testing-ops` to raise issues with prow.k8s.i and CI infrastructure, and #sig-scalability for scale test issues. For CI failures not clearly related to issues with #prow / the infra, you can discuss in #sig-testing and #release-ci-signal.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, July 24th**

Code freeze is happening this week, at 02:00 UTC Wednesday 24th July 2024 / 19:00 PDT Tuesday 23rd July 2024. Out of the 54 enhancements tracked after enhancements freeze, we have 32 KEPs tracked for code freeze as of this writing. If your KEP missed the code freeze deadline, you can file an [exception request](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

Patch releases [1.27.16](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md), [1.28.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md), [1.29.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md) and [1.30.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), which were delayed to incorporate the fix for [CVE-2024-5321](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126161) and a [golang update](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125895).  Update as soon as you can, particularly if you run Windows.

## Featured PRs

### [#126165: PSA: allow container_engine_t selinux type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126165)

This PR updates the Pod Security Standards to include the `container_engine_t` SELinux type, starting with version 1.31. This type is designed for running container engines like Podman and Docker within a container. The change enables running nested containers while still securing activity using SELinux.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 4033: Discover cgroup Driver from CRI](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4033-group-driver-detection-over-cri)

This KEP introduces the ability for the container runtime to instruct Kubelet on which `cgroup` driver to use. Currently, both the Kubelet and the container runtime have configuration settings for selecting the cgroup driver (`cgroupfs` or `systemd`). With this enhancement, synchronization between the Kubelet and runtime settings is ensured, eliminating the possibility of misaligned `cgroup` driver configurations and promoting a single source of truth for the `cgroup` driver.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
