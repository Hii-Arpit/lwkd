## Developer News

The [Steering Committee election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2021#readme) is still in progress, and you have until November 4th to vote (and until October 29 to ask for an exception).  Remember to vote!

Ingress-Nginx has reported [a security hole](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) which may allow users to see secrets belonging to other users if custom snippets are enabled. To patch, you will need to both upgrade Ingress-Nginx and disable custom snippets.

SIG-Release is looking hard at the [Release Team selection process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1714) and would like your thoughts if you're a current, former, or wanna-be release team member.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Final call for enhancements exceptions, Nov. 1**

We are now [three weeks from code freeze](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/oUooDZuzqBE).  If you are working on a cool new feature, we'd like to have it on the [Feature Blog](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/oUooDZuzqBE), and you should maybe contribute to [the discussion around themes for 1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1709).  You should also create placeholder PRs for your docs.

October's patch releases for 1.20-1.22 should be out this Wednesday.

# Merges

* Generic Ephemeral Volumes are [allowed to be raw block devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105682) and have [new e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105659)
* Swapped out `json-iterator` for a [fork of the json stdlib decoder](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105030), for general performance improvements and handling mangled JSON better, although more performance tests would be nice
* Wei Huang cleaned up how the scheduler handles [`--leader-elect` arguments](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105712)
* Plug memory leak in [DeleteCollection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105606)

* client-go [will reuse the same connection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105490) for multiple clientsets, and [sets the Content Type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104327) even in the dynamic client
* `remotePath` and `localPath` are now [separate storage objects](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94165) so that they get handled and cleaned up properly
* Log kubernetes objects [as structs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104877) in JSON format
* [Added plumbing for some PodSecurity metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104217)
