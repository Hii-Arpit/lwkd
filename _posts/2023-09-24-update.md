## KEP of the Week

[KEP 3107 - NodeExpandSecret for CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3107-csi-nodeexpandsecret)

This KEP proposes adding `NodeExpandSecret` to the CSI Persistent Volume source so that it can be sent by the CSI client as part of the `nodeExpandVolume` request to the CSI drivers. CSI spec v1.5 [had added an optional secret field to NodeExpandVolumeRequest](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/pull/457). The `NodeExpandSecret` added by this KEP would support that change. The CSI drivers did not have a method to make use of `secretRef` at the time of Node operations such as Node expansion. This is because the subjected CSI request does not carry a secret or credentials in the request. The Kubernetes CSI have implemented a similar mechanism for Controller operations however. `secretRef` field is available in the CSI PV source and is making use of it during `controllerExpand` request. This KEP adds the same field to the `nodeExpandVolume` request.

This KEP was in alpha in the v1.25 release, graduated to beta in v1.27 and is now targeting to graduate to stable in the upcoming v1.29 release. It has been authored by [Humble Chirammal](https://github.com/humblec).
