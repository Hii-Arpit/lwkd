## Developer News

Welcome to the 5th year of LWKD!  LWKD is brought to you by Josh Berkus and Noah Kantrowitz of SIG-ContribEx.  You can contribute [through the git repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lwkd). As usual for the first issue of the year we'll be summarizing the last 3 weeks or so of development over the holidays.

`dev@kubernetes.io` is the new `kubernetes-dev@googlegroups`: over the holidays, Paris Pittman and others moved us from the old Dev mailing list, to one hosted on the kubernetes.io domain. If you were subscribed to kubernetes-dev, you should be subscribed to the new [dev@kubernetes.io](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/) mailing list now.  Remember to post to the right place!  This move will let us have a real community calendar again.

The [draft charter for Batch WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6299) is up for comment. Nick Turner is now [co-chair of Cloud Provider SIG](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Dq6GTZ7GsjA).

If you are using the fluentd-elasticsearch addon, you [need to update to patch log4j](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/OtGnVrvpYGo).

Linus Arver is [overhauling the Prow documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_gyhQipmK_roYqUtwx-hTwi1tn2sd0aG6vdkBn6fKM/edit#heading=h.avfd7j8judm3) and could maybe use your help.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR heads-ups due, January 27th**

The [1.24 Release Cycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.24) has begun, with a [new crew of community members](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.24/release-team.md) running the show.  That means that the [call for enhancements](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/M5La2aypRdY) is open, and you have until February 3rd to finish your KEP and register it. As last cycle, the PRR Team has requested that any KEPs that require a PRR (most of them) get them a completed PRR questionnaire a week before the enhancements deadline, if possible.

In case you missed it due to holidays, [1.20.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.21.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), [1.22.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), and [1.23.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) were released on December 15th.  For those waiting for the first patch on 1.23, you can upgrade now.  For those using 1.20, it's almost EOL (one more update) and you should really upgrade.

## Featured PRs

With the new cycle just kicking off, we've got some early bird KEPs targeting 1.24.

### [enhancements#3071: Reserve Service IP Ranges For Dynamic and Static IP Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3071)

The `ClusterIP` for a Service can be either automatically allocated from a dynamic range or manually specified in the ServiceSpec. While both of these options work fine on their own, mixing them in the same address space can risk collisions or other network sadness. This KEP outlines an improved address allocator that will better coexist with static IPs.

### [enhancements#3061: Add release artifact signing KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3061)

Hardly a week goes by these days without a software supply chain attack story in the news. To try and be better citizens of this modern landscape, we're moving forward on signed release artifacts. This KEP mostly lays out the reasons and goals behind release signing so we have a clear target to aim towards. On the implementation side the expectation is still that we'll be using `sigstore` though some exact details of tooling are still being worked out. If you're interested in helping with this, please contact SIG-Release. This will theoretically get us to SLSA Level 2, with a whole separate effort being started to [get us to Level 3](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3051) but that is expected to be a much longer road.

## Other Merges

* `kubectl rollout` [has a label selector](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99758) allowing batch upgrades/restarts

* `kubectl logs` [defaults to the "first" container](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105964)
* Don't let [healthz bypass the ResponseWriter](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107034) since that can cause a panic
* If a volume isn't marked in-use, [mount it immediately](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106853)
* `kubectl config set-context` [gets tab completion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106739)

* Don't [release pinned CPUs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104837) until the pod exits
* Don't let [AppArmor validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97966) prevent init containers from adding security profiles

We had a lot of fixes backported to all versions, so you can expect these to show up in next week's update release:

* Creating a badly-formatted Secret [won't crash kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107221); backported
* Fix list paging issue that [caused ResourceVersionMatch to fail](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107311); backported
* Speed up [EndpointSlice controller metrics cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107091); backported
* Keep [stale filehandles](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106906) from hanging; backported

Also, Kubeadm is [making a number of breaking changes](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/eFqHPdwv2i0) in 1.24, including removing dockershim, switching to v1beta3 API, turning the configmap on by default, [requiring a URL scheme](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107295) for CRI, and [letting ca.crt contain multiple certificates](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107327).

## Deprecated

* [kube-scheduler removes insecure flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106865); use `--bind-address` and `--secure-port` instead
* [Remove ImmutableEphemeralVolumes feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107152) since it's GA
