## Developer News

The second [New Contributor Orientations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/mentoring/new-contributor-orientation) will take place on October 15th.  Please recommend them to the aspiring new contributor in your life.

Due to dependency changes in Debian LTS images, [SIG-Release is proposing to stop building artifacts](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/LBlLCWdFN-o) for some architectures.  Discussions continue in SIG-Release.

Aldo Culquicondor has stepped down from WG Batch chair, and has [nominated Kevin Hannon](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/_HW_1SuoQug) to take his place.

The [NA Contributor Summit schedule](https://kcsna2024.sched.com/list/simple/) is live.  Remember to [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/registration/), and if you're going consider [volunteering](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oTPG3raG9xK8DPuicC3b8cBEAqRIyPnVroDQaTu40SI/edit?usp=sharing) to help run the Summit.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 10**

We're in the final week for [Enhancement Opt-In](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/9blOl07EdYc).  Please check your features [on the project board](https://bit.ly/k8s132-enhancements) and make sure their status is correct; if not, get in touch with your SIG lead ASAP.

Speaking of deadlines, patch release cherry picks for the October patches are due Friday.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-3973: Consider Terminating Pods in Deployments](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-apps/3973-consider-terminating-pods-deployment/README.md)

This KEP updates how the Deployment controller behaves when reporting Pod count when Pods are in terminating state. Currently Deployments have inconsistent behaviour in how the terminating Pods are handled based on the rollout strategy. This KEP introduces a new `.spec.podReplacementPolicy` with which users can configure this behaviour. This is similar to the `spec.podReplacementPolicy` in the Job spec and allows users to define if the Deployment should wait for its Pods to terminate before creating new Pods or if it should create them immediately.

This KEP is tracked for alpha in the ongoing v1.32 release.

## Version Updates

After increasing golang versions to [1.23.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127611) and [1.22.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127600), **revert** [back to 1.23.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127861) until the question of alternate architectures is resolved.
