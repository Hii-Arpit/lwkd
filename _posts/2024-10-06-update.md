## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-3973: Consider Terminating Pods in Deployments](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-apps/3973-consider-terminating-pods-deployment/README.md)

This KEP proposes to update how the Deployment controller behaves when reporting Pod count when Pods are in terminating state. Currently Deployments have inconsistent behaviour in how the terminating Pods are handled based on the rollout strategy. This KEP introduces a new `.spec.podReplacementPolicy` with which users can configure this behaviour. This is similar to the `spec.podReplacementPolicy` in the Job spec and allows users to define if the Deployment should wait for its Pods to terminate before creating new Pods or if it should create them immediately.

This KEP is tracked for alpha in the ongoing v1.32 release.
