## Developer News

The second [New Contributor Orientations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/mentoring/new-contributor-orientation) will take place on October 15th.  Please recommend them to the aspiring new contributor in your life.

Due to dependency changes in Debian LTS images, [SIG-Release is proposing to stop building artifacts](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/LBlLCWdFN-o) for some architectures.  Discussions continue in SIG-Release.

Aldo Culquicondor has stepped down from WG Batch chair, and has [nominated Kevin Hannon](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/_HW_1SuoQug) to take his place.

The [NA Contributor Summit schedule](https://kcsna2024.sched.com/list/simple/) is live.  Remember to [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/registration/), and if you're going consider [volunteering](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oTPG3raG9xK8DPuicC3b8cBEAqRIyPnVroDQaTu40SI/edit?usp=sharing) to help run the Summit.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 10**

We're in the final week for [Enhancement Opt-In](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/9blOl07EdYc).  Please check your features [on the project board](https://bit.ly/k8s132-enhancements) and make sure their status is correct; if not, get in touch with your SIG lead ASAP.

Speaking of deadlines, patch release cherry picks for the October patches are due Friday.
