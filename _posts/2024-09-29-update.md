## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness, October 3**

[PRR questionnaires](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md) are due this week.  Make sure you have one for your enhancement.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4815)

One of the original use cases of DRA was to dynamically create and allocate partitions of a full GPU device on demand. As DRA evolved into ["structured parameters"](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381) this ability to dynamically partition devices has been lost. This KEP introduces the ability for "structured parameters" DRA to allocate both full devices and fixed-size partitions of full devices (across multiple dimensions). This happens through a new type called `PartitionableDevice` which has all the same fields as `BasicDevice`, plus two new fields `Includes` and `ConsumesCapacityFrom`. With these new fields, the scheduler has everything it needs to support the dynamic allocation of both full devices and their fixed-size partitions.

This KEP is aiming for alpha in the ongoing v1.32 release cycle.
