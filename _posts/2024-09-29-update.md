## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-4815: DRA: Add support for partitionable devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4815)

One of the original use cases of DRA was to dynamically create and allocate partitions of a full GPU device on demand. As DRA evolved into ["structured parameters"](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381) this ability to dynamically partition devices has been lost. This KEP proposes introducing the ability for "structured parameters" DRA to allocate both full devices and fixed-size partitions of full devices (across multiple dimensions). This is planned to be done by introducing a new type called `PartitionableDevice` which would have all the same fields as `BasicDevice` plus two new fields `Includes` and `ConsumesCapacityFrom`. With these new fields, the scheduler has everything it needs to support the dynamic allocation of both full devices and their fixed-size partitions.

This KEP is aiming for alpha in the ongoing v1.32 release cycle.
