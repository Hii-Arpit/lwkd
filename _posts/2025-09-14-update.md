## KEP of the Week

[KEP-3243: Respect PodTopologySpread after rolling upgrades](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/3243-respect-pod-topology-spread-after-rolling-upgrades/README.md#kep-3243-respect-podtopologyspread-after-rolling-upgrades)

This KEP introduces a complementary field, MatchLabelKeys, in TopologySpreadConstraint to enhance pod topology spread. It allows users to specify only label keys, with kube-apiserver resolving their values from the incoming pod and merging them with the existing LabelSelector to identify the target pod group. This simplifies skew calculation, supports revision-level spreading during Deployment rollouts, and is also handled by kube-scheduler when used in cluster-level default constraints.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
