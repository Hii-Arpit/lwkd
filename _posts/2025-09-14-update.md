## Developer News
 
 The [Kubernetes Steering Committee reaffirmed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/cszZqxoUyWY). that [SIG Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-release/charter.md). and the [Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/README.md). have full authority to enforce policies, deadlines, and requirements, including blocking releases if needed. From the [Steering Committee charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/main/charter.md). perspective, Steering does not override release execution but will back policy updates and clearer communication to ensure safe, stable, and predictable releases.
 
A [medium-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-9708)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N). affects the Kubernetes C# client â‰¤ v17.0.13, where improper certificate validation could enable man-in-the-middle attacks. Users are advised to upgrade to v17.0.14+ and review any custom CA usage in kubeconfig files. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/134063). for more details.
