## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Cycle Begins, Sept. 5th**

You could also [apply to be a Release Team shadow](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.26/release-team.md) if you submit by this Friday.

We are currently in the "clear out the queues" phase between releases. The [release team leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.26/release-team.md) has been selected. Start thinking about what Enhancements you want to work on for 1.26.

## Merges

* LocalStorageCapacityIsolationFSQuotaMonitoring has been [reverted to Alpha](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112076) due to issues with ConfigMaps, as well as being the longest single feature name in Kubernetes history
* etcd metrics [are based on GroupResource](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112042); this may [change how some objects are logged](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111807)
* The scheduler will [retry](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111809) to get pod status on some kinds of errors
* API machinery errors support [`errors.Is` matching](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111808)
* IPVS proxy will not [fall back to IPTables](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111806), and will [sync weights less frequently](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111635)
* Health check metrics will be [published by components](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111771) for data collection, once everything is wired up
* Leader election logic [is consistent between go and Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111758)
* Metrics `finalURLTemplate` got [put back](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111752) after we found out that people were still using it
* Scheduler dumper offers up a [list of pending pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111726)
* Show [all of rollout history](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111093) in kubectl
* Scheduling framework changes [won't break the autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110717)
* Figure out [patch type](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110454) during `kubectl apply`
* Prioritize [zero-cpu-request](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108832) pods
* Let's test and make sure that CRDs won't [recurse forever](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111912), eh?
