If you are a SIG lead, please also [add callouts](https://forms.gle/4gEYi17pbpAa3buw7) for the Summit opening session to find new contributors for your SIG.

The [Summit Social](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/social/) will be at Flanker and will have the usual fun & games.  Unusually, due to Utah law, you will be required to bring an ID/passport.  Also, the Summit is still looking for [volunteers to help staff](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oTPG3raG9xK8DPuicC3b8cBEAqRIyPnVroDQaTu40SI/edit?gid=2080248557#gid=2080248557).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs placeholder PRs deadline, October 24**

We are now in Enhancements Freeze, and [Alpha2 has been released](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/6PppGkhQF4I). For those working on 1.32 enhancements and documentation updates, now's the time to open your PR against dev-1.32 on the kubernetes/website repo. It would be awesome if full docs are ready, but a placeholder PR will keep your contribution on track.  Final exceptions for missed Enhancements are due on Monday.

October patch releases [were delayed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ycnFVQwOlz8) due to Go update issues.  They are available now for [v1.28.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md), [v1.29.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md), [v1.30.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), and [v1.31.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md).

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 784: Kube Proxy component configuration graduation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/784-kube-proxy-component-config)

This KEP proposes a plan to graduate kube-proxy's component configuration to beta, addressing its current complexity. Originally configured via command-line flags, kube-proxy's config became difficult to manage as new features were added, staying in v1alpha1. The current format is hard to use, with poorly grouped options and inconsistencies, making restructuring and stabilization necessary.

This KEP is tracked for alpha release in the ongoing v1.32 cycle.
