## Community Meeting Summary

[Chuck Ha](mailto:chuck@heptio.com) kicked off the [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY) with a demo of [Sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy), a tool for running Kubernetes' recently broadened [conformance tests](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance).  Heptio staff wrote Sonobuoy to make it easier to run the tests, so that contributors will run them more often and prevent unexpected API breakage.

SIG updates this week included [Big Data](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-big-data), where [Anirudh Ramanathan](https://github.com/foxish) explained several of the projects, mostly external, to make data mining and analytics work better on Kubernetes.  First, [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) 2.3 was released that day, with a [top feature of Kubernetes support](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-0.html), and 3 SIG members are now ASF committers.  He also mentioned trying to build a Kube-native version of [Apache Airflow](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/airflow.html), work on [HDFS support](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/kubernetes-HDFS/), and [kube-arbitrator](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-arbitrator) for big data resource management.

SIG [Storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage) has released a number of alpha features in the last few releases, including Container Storage Interface (CSI), local storage support, mount propagation, and volume protection.  They will be working on getting those to GA over the next few releases, also on topology-aware storage for 1.11.  [Multicluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-multicluster) had less encouraging news; first, [Saad Ali](https://github.com/saad-ali) said that they would not be fixing existing bugs in Federation V1 as work moves to Federation V2.   The latter is in its own WG, which is currently in the "brainstorming" phase and plans to have a federation API which is different from the standard single-cluster API.  They are also working on [Cluster Registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/cluster-registry) for multi-cluster metadata, and [Kubemci](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-multicluster-ingress), a CLI for Ingress in multiple clusters.

Announcements: [Phil Wittrock](https://github.com/pwittrock) said that the project will [stop distinguishing between Maintainers and Owners](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1861/files).  [Meet Our Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) is Wednesday, contributor participants wanted.  And Kubecon.EU registration prices go up March 9.

## Release Schedule

We are now in [week 9 of 12 for 1.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md) and in Code Freeze.  During Freeze, only merges for the upcoming release are accepted so that SIGs will focus entirely on stability, bug-fixing, and [technical debt](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-dev/UFCzs-Zjj9E/b3_qjj71AwAJ). Contributors should have already submitted PRs for docs last Friday, and all users should test out the [betas](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.10.0-beta.1).  We are also collecting [known issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/59764).

## Feature Work

Since we are not in Code Freeze, feature commits all target 1.10.

* The Kube-scheduler can now [manage extended resources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60332), which both expands scheduler pluggability and breaks some older default behaviors.
* [DaemonSets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60456), [StatefulSets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60336), and [the garbage collector](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60116) now all have Conformance Tests.
* CRI can now [configure Windows containers using WindowsContainerResources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59333), and [exposes Docker image label data](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58036).
* client-go now has [exec-based support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59495) for third-party authentication providers.
* Both [GCE](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58710) and [AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58625) now support block device volumes.
* Nodeport IP Addresses are [now configurable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58052), supporting clusters with multiple networks.
* The [IPVS feature gateway is now enabled by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60540).
* [Nodes can now request auth tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55019) on behalf of pods running on them.
* Users can now [specify the GID of containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52077).

## Deprecated / Compatibility

* We are now [automatically lower-casing Pod names](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59849) when generating static Pods based on hostname.

## Version Updates

* [Dashboard to 1.8.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57326).

## Other Merges

* [Kubelet now updates Systemd status](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60654).
* [Failed Pods are no longer calculated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60648) towards HPA totals.
* [CRD Finalizers can execute actions during deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60542).
* Kube-scheduler leader election behavior [has been restored](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60524) for 1.9 and 1.10.
* Kubeadm bootstrap certs are [no longer signed by the Kubernetes org](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60385).
* [Set-based selectors now work properly](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59365) with StatefulSets.
* Kube-proxy now [correctly handles IPv4 vs IPv6 chains](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56880) in iptables.

## Graph of the Week

![graph of PRs and issues for the last 30 days in 1.10 milestone](/2018/images/open_prs_milestone.png)

[Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus) worked with [Lukasz](https://github.com/lukaszgryglicki) of the CNCF to add a chart in order to compare workloads across releases.  This shows the number of open issues and PRs by day for a user-selected period, allowing us to compare [v1.10](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/IIUa5kezk/open-issues-prs-by-milestone?orgId=1&from=1517101031268&to=1519779431269&var-sig_name=All&var-sig=all&var-milestone_name=v1.10&var-milestone=v1_10&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes&var-repo=kubernetes_kubernetes&var-full_name=Kubernetes) with [v1.9](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/IIUa5kezk/open-issues-prs-by-milestone?orgId=1&from=1509407831268&to=1511830631269&var-sig_name=All&var-sig=all&var-milestone_name=v1.9&var-milestone=v1_9&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes&var-repo=kubernetes_kubernetes&var-full_name=Kubernetes) and [v1.8](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/IIUa5kezk/open-issues-prs-by-milestone?orgId=1&from=1501804631268&to=1504483031269&var-sig_name=All&var-sig=all&var-milestone_name=v1.8&var-milestone=v1_8&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes&var-repo=kubernetes_kubernetes&var-full_name=Kubernetes) at Code Freeze.  While the counts are slightly high due to a Github data problem, this does show that v1.10 is in good shape compared with prior releases.  However, part of that is because of fewer commits overall to 1.10, so that's not entirely a good thing.
