## KEP of the Week

[Implement maxUnavailable in StatefulSet](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/961-maxunavailable-for-statefulset)

This KEP implements maxUnavailable for StatefulSets during RollingUpdate. Currently if the updateStrategy is set to `RollingUpdate`, the StatefulSet controller will terminate and recreate each Pod in the StatefulSet. Currently the updating of each Pod happens one at a time. Once this KEP adds support for `maxUnavailable`, the updating will proceed `maxUnavailable` number of pods at a time. This also makes it easier to track the revisions of a rolling update. Deployment does this with ReplicaSets.

This KEP hit its alpha milestone in the 1.24 release, and is tracked to graduate to beta in the upcoming 1.29 release. It has bene authored by [Mayank Kumar](https://github.com/krmayankk)
