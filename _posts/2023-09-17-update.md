Patch releases [1.28.2](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/PLiWKzRQOds/m/TMBfN2zUAwAJ), [1.27.6](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/bRFcP62WLRg/m/qsKqQ2nUAwAJ), [1.26.9](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/R8L2sVaL6pc/m/jfI3amXUAwAJ) and [1.25.14](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/bpucSTga8NE/m/wd5eI2XUAwAJ) came out last week. These includes bug fixes for CEL expressions in CRD validation rules incorrectly computing high estimated cost for functions returning strings, lists or maps. Also, Kubernetes is now built with Go 1.20.8.

The [Call for Enhancements](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/MZcoJX6rrm4) is still open. Make sure to opt-in well before the Production Readiness Review Freeze on September 28th to ensure adequate time for reviews.

## Featured PR

### [#119099: [StructuredAuthorizationConfiguration] Implement API types and wire kube-apiserver to use them](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119099)

At long last a refresh for kube-apiserver's authorization controls. While we've long had the ability to configure multiple authorization webhooks via the API objects `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` and `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`, this same ability has not extended to the "at startup" options. There is a webhook, configured via the `--authorization-webhook-*` options but by the nature of the command line flags it's a singleton. While this limitation hasn't been very notable to folks with only one or two clusters, after all you can just do all the setup in-band after it's all up and running, it's much bigger problem for admins in charge of dozens or hundreds of clusters who really need things safe and controlled from the moment the API starts taking requests. And so we have [StructuredAuthorizationConfiguration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration), a new configuration mechanism for the startup-time authorization providers and front and center is an upgraded webhook subsystem in it. This not only brings multiple hooks to the party, it also allows using all the same bells and whistles as the in-band API like CEL expressions for request matching and controlling the schema version sent to the hook.

While this PR sets up the core plumbing for the feature, [a bit more work is needed before you can actually try it out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120154) so subscribe to that ticket if you want to give it a shot as soon as possible.

## KEP of the Week

[Implement maxUnavailable in StatefulSet](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/961-maxunavailable-for-statefulset)

This KEP implements maxUnavailable for StatefulSets during RollingUpdate. Currently if the updateStrategy is set to `RollingUpdate`, the StatefulSet controller will terminate and recreate each Pod in the StatefulSet. Currently the updating of each Pod happens one at a time. Once this KEP adds support for `maxUnavailable`, the updating will proceed `maxUnavailable` number of pods at a time. This also makes it easier to track the revisions of a rolling update. Deployment does this with ReplicaSets.

This KEP hit its alpha milestone in the 1.24 release, and is tracked to graduate to beta in the upcoming 1.29 release. It has been authored by [Mayank Kumar](https://github.com/krmayankk)
