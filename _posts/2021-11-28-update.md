## Developer News

[SIG-Auth is looking](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/3Gl6SBvcQCk) for folks interested in their [several KEPs that need work for 1.24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sY8fRyRtk4eG9R439z5ao5i9bFuuxilS03XaNlqoni0/edit), particularly KMS-plugin. 

SIG-Release has [updated their roadmap](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/f62149d/roadmap.md), including the [addition of the SLSA KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3051) to support supply-chain security.

It's time to [stop using `gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images`](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/jIrBjnw3cDg) and start using `k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images`. SIG-Node could [use some help](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/issues/1528) getting users off of `https://gcr.io/k8s-authenticated-test` if you can lend a hand.  This is part of the [move to community-owned infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/issues/1458).

[Registration](https://forms.gle/oAppmLDggEEGx5tz5) for the Contributor Celebration, to be held Dec 13-18 is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement docs complete, Nov. 30th**

We are only a week from 1.23 release, which means your docs for any new features should already be done.

In this final week, it's critical that you look for, and respond as quickly as possible to, any issues raised by the Release Team.  New test failures or critical bugs at this point could delay the release, so follow up on your email and GH notifications.

## Deprecated

* [`gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images` is deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/96770)

## Version Updates

* [structured-merge-diff *downgraded* to 4.1.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106660) due to a regression in init container ordering
