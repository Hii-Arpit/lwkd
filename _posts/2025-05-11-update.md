## Developer News

SIG-Architecture [updated the KEP Template](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md?plain=1#L389-L395) to better guide future KEPs by explicitly indicating that beta must be complete and promotion from beta to GA must have no significant change for the release. This is the result of a [6-month discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5242). The complete details, motivations, and incremental delivery handling are explained in [Beta Feature Gate Promotion Requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/5241-beta-featuregate-promotion-requirements).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Schedule Begins, May 19th**

The Release Cycle for Kubernetes v1.34 [starts on May 19th](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/2780), with final release on August 27th. [Vyom Yadav is the Release Lead](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/fJUZUabH8vM), with shadows Daniel Chan, Ryota Sawada, Wendy Ha, and Sreeram Venkitesh.

The [May 2025 Kubernetes patch release is delayed to May 15th](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Dgrm1lJsNcs) to accommodate the cherry-picks that were approved by code owners and satisfied the criteria before the deadline of May 9th, but were not merged.

## Featured PRs

[129874: Change the implementation design of matchLabelKeys in PodTopologySpread to be aligned with PodAffinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129874)

**PodTopologySpread**'s `matchLabelKeys` now behaves like PodAffinity's `matchLabelKeys` to ensure consistent scheduling;
A new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge` controls this change (enabled by default); Users upgrading from v1.32 to v1.34 must upgrade step-by-step (from v1.32 to v1.33, then to v1.34), to avoid issues with unscheduled pods using matchLabelKeys.

[131662: DRA: Fix failure to allocate large number of devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131662)

This PR fixes a bug in 1.33 that reduced device allocation per `ResourceClaim` to 16; Now restores support for allocating up to 32 devices per ResourceClaim, ensuring large claims can be allocated as expected and making the DRA reliable for high device counts.
