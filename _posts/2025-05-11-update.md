## Developer News

The Release Cycle for Kubernetes v1.34 starts on May 19th, and the final release cut is being targeted for August 27th. The [PR for the release directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/2780) is created with Vyom Yadav as the Release Lead, along with Daniel Chan, Ryota Sawada, Wendy Ha, and Sreeram Venkitesh.

The [May 2025 Kubernetes patch is delayed to May 15th](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Dgrm1lJsNcs) to accommodate the cherry-picks that were approved by code owners and satisfied the criteria before the deadline of May 9th, but were not merged.

The [KEP Template has been updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md?plain=1#L389-L395) to better guide future KEPs by explicitly indicating that beta must be complete and promotion from beta to GA must have no significant change for the release. This is the result of a [6-month discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5242) in sig-architecture and mailing list threads. The complete details, motivations, and incremental delivery handling can be read in [Beta Feature Gate Promotion Requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/5241-beta-featuregate-promotion-requirements).
