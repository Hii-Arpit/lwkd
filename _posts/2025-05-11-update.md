## Developer News

SIG-Architecture [updated the KEP Template](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md?plain=1#L389-L395) to better guide future KEPs by explicitly indicating that beta must be complete and promotion from beta to GA must have no significant change for the release. This is the result of a [6-month discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5242). The complete details, motivations, and incremental delivery handling are explained in [Beta Feature Gate Promotion Requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/5241-beta-featuregate-promotion-requirements).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Schedule Begins, May 19th**

The Release Cycle for Kubernetes v1.34 [starts on May 19th](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/2780), with final release on August 27th. Vyom Yadav is the Release Lead, with shadows Daniel Chan, Ryota Sawada, Wendy Ha, and Sreeram Venkitesh.

The [May 2025 Kubernetes patch release is delayed to May 15th](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Dgrm1lJsNcs) to accommodate the cherry-picks that were approved by code owners and satisfied the criteria before the deadline of May 9th, but were not merged.
